# AI-Based Price Estimation & Algorithmic Trading Automation With Portfolio Optimization on Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

This project is at the intersection of artificial intelligence, financial analysis, and blockchain technology, focusing on the cryptocurrency market. It leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series forecasting, incorporating both econometric indicators and sentiment analysis to enhance prediction accuracy. The core objective is to provide an AI-driven framework for price estimation and to automate trading strategies with an emphasis on portfolio optimization.

### Key Features

- **LSTM for Time-Series Prediction**: Utilizes LSTM networks trained on historical data from Binance, aiming to forecast future cryptocurrency prices with high accuracy.
- **Econometric Indicators and Sentiment Analysis**: Enhances prediction accuracy by integrating traditional technical analysis indicators with sentiment analysis from various online sources.
- **Automated Trading Strategy**: Implements an automated trading strategy that dynamically adjusts based on the AI's predictions and a set of predefined rules for risk management.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Employs flexible computing techniques to optimize asset allocation within a portfolio, maximizing returns while minimizing risk.

### Results

Alpha testing of our model demonstrated an 88.7% average accuracy in price prediction. This significant level of accuracy underscores the effectiveness of combining LSTM with econometric indicators and sentiment analysis for cryptocurrency price forecasting.

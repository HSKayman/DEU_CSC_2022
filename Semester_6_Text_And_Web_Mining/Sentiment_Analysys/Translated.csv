0,"The third week of school started today. Eventually the classroom was fully available. It seems that we will spend the 2008-2009 academic year with 25 people, of course there may be arrivals and departures.

Last year I was with 1-A, while 1-B was with Aslı. This year 1-A and 1-B merged and we became 2-A. Last year, by Aslı, although it was my first year, we had 1st grade students. Though I started my second term, but okay. Last year, we did whatever we could, we tried hard, we worked and made efforts. Towards the end of the year, we saw that we reaped the fruits of our work. And I was entering so hopeful this year that my dream lasted until the school was opened.

Because all the students of our class did not study in the summer, let alone studying. I was surprised at what I was going through. Even my daughter, who read 75 words per minute in 1st grade and was very fluent in reading this, was reading so slowly that I wanted to cry. Although some students did not finish very well, they were still in the first grade to read quite a bit. Among them, Ercan, Hozan, Büşra shocked me so much that they quit studying and studying for 3 weeks and Hozan and Büşra still could not come to them. Ercan just came to school today :)

My 3-4 students, who come from my master teacher, will make me very difficult. My master teacher was so hard, he spent it reading, at least by spelling; But the students don't even recognize the sounds anymore: S From now on, about 10 people from now on, we will stay in school after school is over and study reading. Let's see what is going to happen.

Of course, the reading part of this work, and they are getting so dumb that we have a lot of work every day :)

Hope we finish at a nice point at the end of the year ?? Come on random ..",1.txt
1,"Hello, we have gathered half of Çırağan's legendary crew, even though we were able to gather. Before going to tomorrow's piloy :) day, we wanted to have an evening pleasure .. How, we had a match that will remember the old days, we were able to do nothing from the tiredness of that match, and we came to ourselves with a shower, after we satiated with our meal, the terrace pleasure started ..
-
We sat on the terrace and put together the chips - cola - peanuts - very science A quartet. This did not get our energy, it added energy :) .. We toured the neighborhood and enjoyed ice cream. When we came back with the okey team, it was obvious that it would not be very difficult to come back from 11.30 to the present (03.), And it also happened. A cunning ispirli could not take it any longer and the event got out of hand and stones were pouring from my pocket when the game was over :)) ..
-
I hope that now our class teacher is coming to Istanbul from the school that was appointed for the meeting of qualified people. I am always happy to be in such a crew, and now I am happy as well. It protects against people :)

I hope to bring you a small review article after the piloy day tomorrow, maybe tomorrow night will be longer. :))",10.txt
2,"I can say that we brought Istanbul upside down.

My uncle called me in the morning to ask if you could buy some spices from Egypt Market. This request I received from him is my order and I immediately made a plan. I told them that my uncle was looking at the weather in Istanbul on the internet and that he was very beautiful, because he loved my uncle Orhan and Dilek very much. AKSOY ?? s words are not broken that they did not do it and our adventure started.

First of all, we went to the Auto Market and started researching automatic gear and diesel cars. I think we were in 2-3 hours on Sunday. (Prices are cheaper on the internet: S) Then we skipped Beyazit ?? a. We walked in Beyazit to Sultanahmet for sightseeing and taking pictures.

When I came to Sultanahmet Square, I remembered a very old tree photo I posted on Facebook. I took a picture of that tree 3-4 years ago and I was very curious about its current state. We circumambulated the square in the dark, and I dragged Orhan and Dilek from behind me. I persisted that I should see that tree. Search for God, call for God, no brother agaç: S Dilek ?? in ?? yaw as if we are looking for a burial ?? The word hit me in a strange way, I felt like I gave up looking good-bye, so it would be more correct if I said that my desire has decreased. Velhasil, I couldn't find that tree in the dark, but next time I go, I will find reason.

After Sultanahmet Square, we went down to Gülhane Park next to Topkapi Palace. We sat down in the park for a while and I tried to take some pictures. It was not fun at all because it was dark. We chatted a little. Then, after walking the Gülhane Park singing songs, we took our breath in Sarayburnu. We went from Sarayburnu to the Egyptian Bazaar, singing and singing. We bought the spices my uncle wanted from me (us). The man who sold the spices told us a lot of creepy stories about people with 3 letters Dilek and I would shake, we were furrowed

After Egypt Market, we passed to Eminönü's coastal side and reached Karaköy by walking on the bridge. We went to Istiklal Avenue from Karaköy through Tunnel.

We looked for the boots that Dilek saw on the feet of Su in Kavak Yelleri on Istiklâl Caddesi. We walked around the shops, took photos, looked at entertaining places and so on. We felt we were hungry. Actually, he calls me stingy, but we went into McDonalds even though I did not rebel so much because of the economic squeeze of Orhan. I just sang nuggets with remorse. It is for the girl in the cash register to fill the quota and earn 100 credits. While we were buying the food, Dilek ?? An old lady sat next to her.

When I said what is what this lady, I immediately got to know. In his words, a young lady with shoes like a baby grave stepped on the feet and was very hurt. He immediately sat down at our table, and Dilek, who likes to talk to people as much as I do, set the stage. I brought the food to the table and Dilek and Orhan went to the sink, this time I dived deeper into the conversation at McDonalds and chatted with that old lady for about 2 hours.

I say lady because she is really a lady of Istanbul. She lives alone in Gümüssuyu in a very decent neighborhood. 2. did not get married after her husband passed away. His financial situation is very good and he loves to live life. He says, where the movement is, I'm there. He tells us that I have traveled all over Turkey and even many countries of the world, but I could not find the excitement I found on Istiklâl Caddesi anywhere. He has never worked all his life, has always lived with fun, and even now he is very, very happy. He told about the places he went to dance in his youth, the lifestyle they lived in those days, and it was so enjoyable for us to talk to that lady. It was the name that added color to the night for us.

After supposedly feeding our stomach (!), We dived into Istiklâl Caddesi again and realized that we were not able to look around, we decided that returning home was the most logical option. Tired but happy, we dispersed into our homes.

It was a wonderful day for me, Orhan ?? a and Dilek ?? Thank you forever. Everything was great, you are glad you are.

I wish everyone a happy life",100.txt
3,"hey hey !!!! I'm so happy my exams are over. I swear I'm very happy girl. I couldn't study for the last exam last night because the exams were going to end. Mummy said, ""baby, what is it to get excited about? Do you do something when your exams are over? It's as if you come home again."" In other words, if even the mother of man makes fun of his asociality, his situation is bad. but I am not unhappy at all. though the doctor gave prozac so it could be.

I could not sleep last night again. At the middle end, there were 4 girls in another branch, we did not talk at all, they were girls in their own right, at 8 c. I was trying to remember their names. Mergezer, elif, brilliant, and ... I couldn't remember the name of the fourth. ABOUT what I was telling me, whatever. let me sleep but it drove me crazy. So I got up and looked at the middle school yearbook. I could not find the fourth daughter. So they were threes. This disappointed me. then I read the yearbook, the high school part. They were all children 3 years older than me. but what a beautiful generation it was. then I closed my eyes and saw in my dream secondary school that I graduated from.

I'm so happy i am so happy maybe tomorrow I'll go to sea hunters. Or at least let me look for that valiant light. came to mind.",101.txt
4,"On January 29, 2007, a long time has passed since I wrote my last article on Milliyet Blog pages, where my first article was published. My last post is on November 26, 2008. It has been about four months. We Won't Always Get Bad News Ya! ?? I hope you remember the good news I gave you in my article titled?
In this period when I was away from you and the MB ?? I have experienced many events that made me happy both in my private life and in my work on the Turkish Aeronautical Association. For example, I became a grandfather on January 18, 2009. (I learned that this topic is on our MB page and that some of my friends show the courtesy of congratulating me with their messages in the Logbook.) I was happy with the way THK Çankaya Branch Young Wings made in aviation. My dear Sabiha Gökçen has crowned my happiness with the inclusion of his picture in the Google logo on his death anniversary (March 22).
It has been raining in Ankara for the last three days.
Even though the sun shows its face every now and then, an effective rainfall still persists. I perceive these rains as the gift of the sky to the nature, which begins to come alive with the spring. ""Abundance is pouring from the sky"" With the words of my late grandmother. With these rains, the seeds that have fallen on the ground will turn into a sapling, and the saplings will turn into trees. The old trees that have witnessed the flow of years, will still embrace the land and life ??
For some people, this covered sky and rain, which evoke gloom and sadness, created such a mood in me; happy and hopeful for the future ??
This happiness is the ""abundance"" of the traditional Anatolian sages loaded in the rain. Besides its description, it also stems from the idea that less of our forest will be sacrificed to fires in the coming summer.
Yes, Dear Milliyet Bloggers / Readers, My friends, less of our forest area will burn in this summer season. Our new Fire Planes, which will be the guardian angels of our forests, will stretch their wings over our forests like guardian angels, and will do whatever it takes to prevent forest fires. The hero Fire Pilots of the Turkish Aeronautical Association will go to the fire fight with greater faith and stronger.
It has been raining in Ankara for the last three days.
On Friday, March 20, 2009, at 18.07, a plane landed at Esenboğa Airport, which airport personnel do not often encounter. An amphibious aircraft, purchased by the Turkish Aeronautical Association, with a water throwing capacity of 5.5 tons, capable of supplying water from both land and any water source (sea, lake, dam, etc.).
This plane, which Milliyet Blog writers and readers contributed to the purchase, donated by the bank and by phone messages, reached its new home at 20.55, after the customs procedures were completed, and the Türkkuşu General Directorate, Etimesgut Square. He is now waiting for his other four siblings to arrive.
It has been raining in Ankara for the last three days.
This rainy weather creates neither gloom nor sadness in me. I am happy, my friends.
I became a grandfather on January 18, 2009. Turkish Aeronautical Association Çankaya Branch Genç Wings has come a long way in aviation. On the eighth anniversary of his death; Girl of Sky, Turkish Girl, Atatürk Girl Dear Sabiha Gökçen, decorated the Google logo with her bright face. I believe I have contributed to the purchase even if it is small; The first of 5 amphibious firefighting aircrafts with 5.5 tons of water throwing capacity came to Ankara ??
In the last İnönü Meeting, you know, on behalf of this name ?? Cemal Uygun / Milliyet Blog İnönü Spring Meeting ?? Saying, Dear Cemal Uygun, Dear Alev Meisel, in the meeting where my teacher could not attend? I see you sad. If the reason for this sadness is what is posted on Milliyet Blog, do not worry about it. This attitude does not suit the pilot of my leader ???? He said. Dear Alev, I wish you could see me these days .. I think you would see my happiness at first sight.
These planes were acquired with a long effort. Sleepless days, tense moments, bargains to the point of breaking. I do not want to write these and bother you. But, in the purchase of these planes, he has free himself from limitations such as working hours, respects his work and sometimes spends a whole week traveling. I would like to send my heartfelt thanks to my dear friend Mr. A. Tarık Akça, the Director of Turkish Aeronautical Association Gökçen Aviation, who made superhuman efforts to purchase these planes under the most favorable conditions without going to sleep, resting, maybe even going home. (My friends who attended the last Milliyet Blog İnönü Meeting will definitely remember Mr. A. Tarık Akça with his beautiful presentation.)
It has been raining in Ankara for the last three days.
I am very happy, my dear friends. Today, I was on the plane that came first from the 5 Amphibious aircraft purchased by the Turkish Aeronautical Association. I posted the list of names of my friends, whose names I wrote in some of my writings, in the cabin of this plane, which resembles a huge hangar, from Milliyet Bloggers. Also, the open names of my friends who want their names to be kept secret and not to be written in my article in MB ??
It has been raining in Ankara for the last three days.
I'm happy my friends ??",102.txt
5,"I now understand better what it means to want and ""fail yet"".
I like to close my eyes at the table and pretend to play the piano, and imagine that the book in my hand is my own book ... I like to never get full, to always find something to want to do, and to get strength from it.
I don't care what people are, who they are or who they want to be, and what they're trying to do. I have no worries about who Mozart, Bach, Orhan Veli are, where the young person is going, or how likely he is to exist tomorrow, which is a news of what we should have in this life. Today I am so happy ...
I love living life at my fingertips. I love to live my thoughts, pleasures, desires, hatreds on my fingers. I love being able to say words to the harmony of letters, to name what I write, to be able to compose the sounds coming from my guitar. I love to wait for the day when I can meet my wishes ...
Now, this is my birthday. The day I started feeling, when I could stand on my own feet. An immaculate expectation, a bright future. My inability to read literature, my title I gained from being included in the herd; I'm a computer engineer, but whatever I do, my family is always there for me.

I was 160 and 77 kilos at the age of 30, I had to quit the 2nd day, sometimes I was defeated by my will, I often dropped my blood pressure, I could not reach the result, I lost 9 * 10 kilos in one month and 12 * 13 kilos in the other month, and I got it back for months. I did not lose weight because of those drugs, I did not look after it, I went home, I ran 3 * 5 km a day in the first days, I ran 3 * 5 km a day, and then I left it because it works in the long term, and then I went because these huge vibrating devices are vibrating and weakened by vibrating I bought it, but generally the room was very expensive I tried it for a while, again, the room did not work, I was going to get mad, now I was going to be depressed with 160 cm and 77 kilos. I could not use expensive tools for a long time because of these pounds, I could not use it for a long time. We entered the market of a big shopping center, happy with my mother I looked there to do fax shopping, there is a crowd there, you know twist stippers or you know where you are, you step on the spring or something, the folks were on the campaign, I said 49 ytl, I said, I gave the money of the world to the previous tools and they were all brands even they were working in the long term. I didn't even hear this 49-year-old brand, I said it would work, and I said whatever it is boring, I will take it where I am at home, I said it will be my name. I asked a girl who bought it at that time. He took fat, he strengthened his muscles, he lost 8 kilos per month, he said, I was shocked, I bought it with 49 YTL 12 installments immediately, and I brought it home, girls believe me, it is great, I can hardly take 200 steps in 6 minutes, I am so tight your springs but in 6 minutes you are in sweat and your legs are officially flesh broken Two laths are attached to the bidet tips, pull them and you melt your arm fat in the rest I think I am pulling it, it is hard to pull it in every 2 steps when you take a step, because when you add salt or something, your arms shake, it is such a disgusting image I got rid of that image it became like stone my arms did not cross my sleeves I think my arms were weakened, my legs were left where they were in the night :) I was amazed that I could buy something nice for such a cheap price I could not coincide if I searched there is a small indicator showing the number of steps per calorie per minute I burn 200 steps 30 calories in 6 minutes I repeat this in the form of 6-minute 200-step 30-calorie sessions I can not do more yet I can't afford it folks I can do it even for 15 minutes in a day out, I can't afford it yet, guys, I feel both cheap and healthy, I feel very healthy.",107.txt

I said okay, everyone who is close to hitting the bottom is happy somehow, I heard him and I am happy. Then I went to Yunus Emre Kultrü center with a friend (which I met for the first time) and met the neyzen in OR. But there was one crazy chello player. The man is in love with the charisma and intrigue you know. I listened to him for a long time. He is so sincere and warm that I do not tell. Next to him was brother Ali, the room was accompanying him with Udi oud. They make a good couple. By the way, when the notes were too high, brother Ali went so far that Uda went to the bottom fret of the bottom wire and then stopped suddenly, he said, `` Where did this kid go? ''
This reaction from a 60-year-old man made me laugh. Then the cello player started hitting the strings with his fingers and took the cello to his knee. It started like a saz, I had a lot of fun playing, I hope I will join them after Eid.

Piloy Many people from the founding director of our school to our advisor who was appointed to Rize attended our day. 06 11 As Science-A, we enjoyed piloy day at 15:00 as the first ones to go to school. We had the chance to chat with many people from the lower and upper periods.

I was delighted to see the face of a friend whose contact has been getting weaker for 1.5 years due to reasons. After the chats and chapters, we were in our conference room with a video consisting of photos that would make the old days remember. It was proud that many of the photos in the video were taken by Turgut Reis's crew, that is, us. I think it is well known by everyone that we are a photo freak {I am waiting for a comment from Ünalım here :)}.

Here is a photo from that video at the top .. Photos of Murat and Enes taken by me in High School-1 :) .. These scenes touched us all. Getting together with the rice day may make you happy, it is a great relief, but it is a clear fact that these scenes make people very sad.

We did an ice cream tour in the neighborhood :) .. I said goodbye to Sefa and Halid at 2 am and to Murat, Muhammed, Enes and Melih this morning. for what I said. But this article really made me feel those beauties a little bit more, the beauties that are exceptional enough to be able to print an article of this length to me without hesitation ..

14,"Our school is a really bad school in terms of student profile. The children are so independent, so stubborn, so insightful, so combative, so much that I can't tell (some good students should not be included in this group). Although I am a 2nd grade teacher, I come across these vagrants during my school shifts, while spending time in the garden, when the school enters and exits. I usually see them while being a beast, or someone comes near me, my teacher, who was born, treated me like this, he is troubled because he did this to me. Because both my size, my tone of voice, and my harsh attitude at school cause the oppressed students to worry me. Anyway? In our school there are 5-10 types of direct drop-outs (150 people in our school, etc.). The dress they come to school does not pass next to the school uniforms, the hair begins to be a weird, the movements are that way, when the teacher says something, they stand up and so on and so forth.

I showed my teeth to 2-3 of them in good time and I started to ignore them. They make an event every minute, disturb their friends, have their teachers drawn illallah ?? At a meeting we held yesterday at the school about such a type, we, as all teachers, faced trouble with our principal; Because the student harms both the teachers, the school, the students and himself. Our manager said he would take care of the issue and ended the meeting so there were 1-2 more students left in me ??

So, today I had a relationship with one of the students that I remembered. Our last lesson was body and we were in the garden. The 7th grade class was empty and they were wandering in the garden and playing. Do you want to run around in school to play hide-and-seek, to talk abusive? Anyway, I warned them, I looked at my lesson. The end of the lesson bell rang and the students started to go out. We were waiting in the garden for the school to be evacuated because we were going to study. Meanwhile, a student came running to me and ""Doğan Hodja, Melik hits us with a chain."" said. I turned and looked back, Melik is there and he has a chain in his hand.

D: Son put the chain in your pocket go home.
M: Neee, sananeeee!
D: Son, take that chain, go home, leave your friends alone.
(Hands and arms swinging in the air)
M: Sanane sanane, do I ask you?
D: Son what's wrong with you? What do you want?
(With hands and arms in the air and staring at the face)
M: Go, am I going to ask you !?

After passing a conversation, I said give it chain and did not. I also took it by pulling it from his hand. Then ?? Get out of your house now! ?? I gave way, saying. His friends took this by my side and started to move forward. He had taken 1-2 steps when he turned his head halfway towards me, hinting at me, with a dirty grin, he literally gave me a fuck-stick tongue. When I saw this, I could not stand it anymore and I took it to the manager room as I held it by the neck. I started shouting at this and starting to hear provocative, sarcastic facial expressions and words at every shout. I've been guilty, I've been a bum! Actually I was going to let go and give way; But I continued my behavior just because he would rub his nose a little, maybe it would come a little on his head; but I was faced with a worse reaction than my behavior, and you see me? , ?? I'll get you kicked out of school! ?? When I started making threats like this, I got more aggressive now. I kept shouting loudly and shook 1-2 swearing at the same time, so that he could understand the seriousness of the work; but I saw worse reaction from him. I feel like ?? Yuh! ?? I held it by pulling the back of the neck ?? I threw him out of the room.

At that time, the Director took it and started talking. Still the boy was standing up and lying. No, he did nothing, no I beat him, swore! He was an angel! Entering my class, I canceled the study because I was angry and sent the children home. The principal was talking to his room where he took Melik, so I entered. He was still blaming me and saying that I cursed him or something. I was the only criminal who didn't do anything of his own.

While I was warning him in the garden, our Servant Nizamettin was with me and although he told Melik like that, he was still trying to get on top. No, he beat me, no he cursed me! I said, too, if I beat you, you wouldn't be able to stand up again when I didn't. Meanwhile, wouldn't he say to me too ?? The main thing is that if I beat you, you wouldn't be able to stand up! I said with a laugh, everyone's nervous now and our manager raised his tone; but he still continued to stand up to me and my manager. My manager could not stand it anymore and he said go to me, Dogan Hodja, and I pulled back and came to my house.

I have been so angry for two days because of the strange students in this school that I cannot tell. They stand up to us, they walk on us back and forth, they raise their arms when we say something, they don't listen to the word ??

I can't understand what we're going to do. Beating is forbidden in education, I don't know what it is, it is forbidden, this is forbidden. Try to win children try to win I didn't understand how far. Even if we try to talk nicely, I do not know how long our business will continue with the children who stand up against us, stand up and threaten us.

Maybe for the first time in my life I was so angry. Though, when I was yelling at the kid at first, I was just pretending to be angry to intimidate it; But after he threatened me and started swinging beside the principal, I really got on my nerves.

I take care of his brother in one class, and Melik ?? e. It is impossible not to call this diet, this salad pickle. They did not say for nothing that 5 fingers are not one in five.

One more day like this has come and gone. Let's see what kind of abominations we will have with these self-aware students tomorrow?",111.txt

Either we used this sound to joke around in elementary school or something. We used to swear in our voices and then laugh. You may be writing words with a depth that I cannot understand, I don't care. no, actually it is not the voice of this man that I am angry with. people are so insensitive to this sound.

20,"today I think I attended an action for the first time in my life.

Last Friday, an exorbitant monthly fee was charged for the next year in the dormitory where I stayed at school. Let me say that there is a 57.3% increase so that I can make sense of it both numerically and give it fractional amount so that nobody will hit it. today, about 200 people walked around the dormitories to the rectorate. I had a banner, how difficult it was to carry it. My arms broke off after a while.

The point I'm really nervous is this. The action that took place today was unrelated to any political view. however, there were not even a tenth of the students staying in the dormitories affected by the increase today. Men who had nothing to do with raise came just to support us, they were not there. We went in front of their dormitories and shouted for them to come with us. However, people preferred to watch and laugh at us from the window and take pictures with their cell phones. It is this insensitivity that annoys me today. even though they are affected by themselves and not others. I'm sorry. so much.

Who knows what exactly would happen if I could fly?

Today was interesting. It's even more interesting now. Everything is even more interesting. I have a feeling that it will happen. It's all the fault of Boring Machines Disturb Sleep. Although I don't seem to care about anything done, it's futile.

I remember a line saying ""All your endeavor to get rid of me is futile"", that comes to mind. It is actually a futile effort for everyone to understand where these words, which seem like crazy at the moment, can actually touch me inside. No need, never mind.

There are so many strange things happening inside me. It will take time to get used to it. Today, I have questioned enough of my life in that fun. Then I put someone else in it. It looked beautiful for the first time. It would be nice if he always stayed like that. K. also approved. If I'm writing something while I'm in this state, I guess I'm writing because I'm in a mood that I haven't been in for a long time.

Nobody should be surprised if this article destroys itself tomorrow, it is a futile request that no one should read it until then, just like the efforts in that line. Who knows where I stole it anyway.

I have something to tell tomorrow, but I don't know if I will. Just Happy Songs for Happy People I think it's a really despicable album. It creates an effect on the human being that makes the mood of the human being so intense and that can bring to the surface the things that could hardly be ignored by the superficialities of the day. I'm cursing a lot right now, but it would be bad to write here now. At least I don't want my swearing to be literally recorded. I swear more than anyone else about my use of Turkish, don't worry. My non-stop control madness is dripping from every word of this article, which I am currently writing as I am. I am also pissed off for this. No matter what I do, I can't get rid of it. Even in this case I am correcting dot virgl. Who said that I was a sincere person, and I could get out of it, maybe in the eyes of others, but I am still the same in my own eyes. I guess that's the bad thing.

It's as if I need to sleep even worse. If I talk more, it sounds like I will say words that I will have to close this place forever, but I want to keep quiet as I will have to close and burn some notebooks forever if I do. Someone from the outside has to say that I have to be silent. Since I am sitting alone, there is no noise from anyone at the moment, so I ask why I should not write until the morning. I assume that if I write until the morning, there will be no one left who would want to stay in my life. Then I say to be quiet again. I know I'm bullshit.

That's why I sleep. Everything that is far away from me. Or do not know. Either Banane.

But no, it doesn't sleep after a certain point. Realizing that I am writing the craziest stuff this place has ever seen and buried, I let go I am amazed at how happy people can be. I guess I was happy a few hours ago, too. I dance funny to absurd songs. I was smiling at people. Then there is a big gap. It's like Cymbals Eat Guitars' Like Blood Does, which has three different moods and rhythms, slow and dead in the morning, deciding to live at the last minute in the afternoon and returning, then re-clinging to life with that enthusiasm where instruments collide and explode. Ultimately, the big bang and the stupidity of starting something for the first time at the time, the confusion, the stupidity (I wonder why such words include ""s"" and ""sh"") and all the ""sh"" s. I started writing like you, but no I don't do it. It would be pointless. I felt obliged to say something. Or whatever you want to know. Banane again.

First experience of that big bangy ending and after. Sooo much back to some old moments. The coming to mind of Google as we increase the number of ""O"" s. It is the connotation of going to different pages when pressing the ""O"". Indeed, those pages of different experiences suddenly passed in front of your eyes with a film strip-like nonsense. It means I shouldn't be so disloyal. To bother yourself. To give the least value to those that should be valued most. Annoying again. Considering how much more I can write in such a loop, the nature of the loop is to converge to infinity. Then a word spoken at that moment. The pleasing of that promise, the response and the damn it is still looking for a catch in happiness. Am I crazy?

I seem to be capsized by the disgusting connotation of resisting sleep, the delicacy of the butterfly's wings and hence the unpleasantness, as the uneasiness of a possible future dream prompts one to sleep and not to think more. I have a feeling that I have closed every moment that makes me happy. It is not a feeling that I have already written this somewhere. One thinks how can I move forward when everything I have written is a huge burden on me. Now there are only a few moments when I can think of myself as a human. While listening to some songs. For example a Brainy or a La Ritournelle.

How do normal people live? Hoping for something, I guess. There is no point in living without it. But I can't feel like an abnormal person either. If I did, I guess I wouldn't be writing here right now. I strongly vanished the possibility and so on ...

But what is the problem, let's leave hope or something, as if I cleansed myself of all the elements that make a person normal or abnormal. Yeah I ate good shit. This is a completely different issue, of course. It's like I'm in Freddy's Nightmares series and slept never waking up. He's always dreaming. I just can't wake up to the truth. Vyea I don't know, I'm awakened to the truth and I want the return. Every once in a while, I smile at those comeback opportunities. But like real people. I missed smiling so much in myself without any different movement inside.

As a missing person, it is not customary to miss such things. I can not do it even if I want to. If they asked who you missed last time, I have to think for 1.5 years to answer the question. Even if I answer later, I cannot even describe that feeling. But sometimes I miss the reactions I give at certain moments. For example, being awakened from sleep with a message. The dream that I saw that message and slept with a meaningless smile on his face ... To be happy with a single word when I was bored. But really happy. In other words, I am talking about a happiness that I was able to sacrifice my life as much as I could forget my biggest distress at that time. It's not just a happiness that makes you smile with half a mouth. To hell with such happiness anyway. Could it be as idiotic as knowing that the greater and more intense the moments of happiness that a person has experienced in his time, the more disappointment he will experience, and therefore to close himself to possible moments of happiness? Of course it will. I know him well. I know as closely as anyone knows someone else at Tribeca at breakfast one afternoon. Damn them all ..

Still, nobody should be afraid. I talk so much, but I want to hope that I am not a person who can stand so insightful that such a moment of happiness appears next to me, not touching it. Let's throw people like me - I doubt if anyone else exists - into the room where we block those who make us like us. Let's slaughter each other. Let the winner win the prize or something.

I have to end the article somewhere. Otherwise, bad expressions will be spilled one by one. I am in a position to ""take care"" of ""one thing"" other than myself that I don't want to touch anyone. If that thing finds me and can demand to take care of itself forever, I won't put my best into it, but I guess where i end and you begin.",12.txt

29,"It is a condition in which complaints that can be diagnosed with both mania and depression are experienced almost every day for at least a week. It is thought that this diagnosis is present in approximately 1/3 of the patients with bipolar disorder.

Mixed (mixed) mood episode criteria:

1- Both manic episode and major depression attack criteria should be experienced almost every day for at least a week, except for their duration criteria.

2- The complaints of this mood disorder should be at a level that may lead to significant impairment in occupational or social functionality, cause problems in relationships with people, feel the need for hospitalization in order to prevent behaviors that harm themselves or those around them, or may lead to possible psychotic symptoms.

3- Symptoms should not be due to a substance, drug, treatment or other bodily disease.

Appearance form:

In these people, a short-term temporary crying state, a depressed mood, even thoughts of self-sacrifice can be seen in the period when the symptoms of manic attacks are the highest or during the transition from mania to depression. In addition, an excessive acceleration in the flow of thoughts during depression is another form of appearance. In these people, irritability, panic attacks, loud and intrusive, unstoppable speech, aggression, self-destructive thoughts, insomnia, grandiose thoughts and excessive sexual acts and thoughts, as well as delusions of persecution, and a blurry consciousness of which their behavior is not aware can be seen.

It is mostly seen in young people and people over 60 years old. Since their distress levels are higher, they apply more for treatment.

The importance of mixed mood disorder:

The manic features of this condition progress with severe symptoms (mood swings, intense anxiety, guilt thoughts, psychotic symptoms). In this type of mood disorder, manic symptoms also last longer than known mania. Suicide is also seen at a higher rate in these patients.

Coexisting psychiatric disorders:

Alcohol-substance abuse

-Obsessive compulsive disorder

- Migraine, some diseases with convulsions.

Treatment:

Drug therapy and psychotherapy are used in the treatment of the disease. The principles of treatment are the same as for depressive disorders.


Mixed Anxiety

This disorder can be diagnosed in the presence of the following items.

A-A mood-state showing malaise, unhappiness and restlessness that continues its existence continuously or repeatedly for at least one month.

B- This unhappiness-restless mood must accompany at least four of the following symptoms that have existed for at least a month.

1-Difficulty concentrating (concentrating) on ​​a subject or activity, or when the mind enters emptiness, confusion.

2- Difficulty falling asleep or getting up in the morning tired, not restful sleep.

3-The feeling of exhaustion and decrease in energy level.

4- Nervousness, restlessness, feeling of tension at the slightest thing, excessive reactivity (irritability).

5-The state of sadness and sorrow.

6-Tears are ready to flow immediately, don't cry easily.

7-The state of not being in place, wandering here and there with distress.

8-Always waiting for the worst of the events that may happen, feeling that you may encounter the most negative.

9-Hopelessness, a general pessimism about the future, a feeling of hopelessness.

10-Low self-confidence, feeling worthless.

C- These complaints should cause a significant distress and tension in the person or cause impairment in the person's professional, social or other functional areas.

D- Complaints should not occur due to the effect of another substance or a general bodily disease.

E- These criteria should not meet any depressive disorder, anxiety disorder or any other psychiatric disorder.

It tends to last longer than depression or anxiety disorders, and individuals' functionality is also affected more negatively than these. In these individuals, more advanced personality disorders can be encountered compared to the other two disorders. During periods of increased tension in these individuals, the discomfort can be replaced by an anxiety disorder such as depression or panic disorder.

According to the studies conducted abroad, its prevalence in the society was found to be 1%. It is four times more common in women than in men.

Causes of occurrence:

These people have increased activity of the noradrenergic system, abnormalities related to GABA and serotonin. As a result of the increase in the activity of the system that manages our internal organs, which we call the autonomic nervous system, digestive complaints may be observed. In these individuals, increased activity was observed in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands, which are interrelated.

It was observed that the affected people had experiences of loss, fear, tension, physical or emotional threats about themselves or their immediate surroundings before the onset of the disorder.

Treatment:

Drug therapy and psychotherapy are used in the treatment of the disease. The principles of treatment are the same as for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders.",126.txt

I was so girl or girl
 
I took the bus to go to the market, a stop after me got on an old woman and a mentally retarded boy next to me. The woman is quite old and I guess (I think she was, of course she was) uneducated, the kind we call ignorant. No, that was what I thought of that woman at first.
The woman sat the 13-year-old boy on her lap, the boy kept saying I was open and said he wanted oranges. He was also moving. The man they are sitting next to (actually not a man, but a piece of wood, ass, scum, creatures created in the form of a human being, or I don't know how to insult me ​​yet, I am very angry) after a while, 'don't do my child, sit down, don't do it, just stop a little' Be as comfortable as you want, tissssss) what are you doing? Your shape also uses words that qualify as half a sentence. The old woman constantly hits the child on it. I thought it was the ignorance I wrote in the beginning, but the main reason was not his ignorance, but the public pressure he had suffered in trying to educate this child all this time. It is not the crime of having such a child, the crime is about it, believe that such a thing will never happen to him, the pressure of the unnecessary human investigator, his lack of understanding, his dishonesty. Anyway, hush, after sitting down, MAHLUKAT constantly tried to direct the child to the empty seats. Look, you are empty, go sit there, look, you are late, they sat down, hums and tricks. I was just going to turn around and dive into the Creature, the man sitting on the opposite side (a man like a man), that is, emptied and summoned the boy to his side. The old woman sat there, very reluctantly, the child. When the boy started playing with the bag of the man he was sitting next to, another blow came from the old woman. It's a tragicomic incident, I must say with embarrassment, I laughed. Anyway, the man turned to the woman and said why do you hit him, let him play, this is my postage, I allow him '. The woman stopped hitting, to continue later :) Anyway, the boy was still talking about orange (potoko, potoko, potoko). Another female passenger gave the child one of the bullcases given to her from the women's days she was gone. However, the boy must have disliked the bulgarian from which he started eating that he started to pull it out of his mouth. While I was waiting for the floor to get dirty (by the way, the woman started hitting again), the Man she was sitting next to (after which I had SUPREME PERSON) took the child's mouth and wrapped it in a napkin. The woman continues to shoot, the man was angry again, because he did not like it. I admire the man. That's great. Man with a mustache, bald, dark, middle-aged, daddy. As I got off the bus, I turned to the man and I knew he was the only 'teacher, I was late to intervene, but I hope I can cultivate tolerance of all my students like you, have a good day' I was embarrassed and still embarrassed that I did not intervene and embarrass O MAHLUKA.
We just spoke with Efe, who is more experienced than me on this subject. I wonder how to educate the families of these children, but after I hang up the phone, the problem is not education in families, the problem is educating the society. The old woman has developed a defense in this style after her previous bad experiences. Hit the boy! That old woman who was so socially excluded, stimulated by society, that she could not know the pointlessness of hitting that child. This must be the pressure of the neighborhood. Half-ignorant neighborhood pressure.
I asked Mahir Efe, what can I do as an individual? I do not want to be a part of volunteer organizations, their aims do not satisfy me or there are some people who do not give confidence. What can I do as a principal? How can I help you individually? Mahir Efe has offered a few suggestions, I hope my attempts will not be inconclusive.
What do you think I can do? What have you done?",130.txt
35,"I did not know when I was posting this title. But somehow I know now. Animal Rights defenders are angry. Maybe I'm a little offended by animal lovers. Now you will ask why? If I say zoo. No, I don't want a house instead of a zoo. You don't get it, I'm angry with the so-called animal lovers who invented something called the zoo. He takes animals from beautiful places to live and throws them behind chains. We supposedly love them. So what would it be like if he took a bear and locked you in a cave? I think you agreed with me after a little thought.



Isn't it important that the white lamb you see in the sample picture grows freely and freely on the mountains? Perhaps someone has been making us forget the concept of my freedom lately. Since my site is about cinema, I recommend you watch the movie Vforvendetta right now. These days, we are a society where the meaning of the concept of freedom makes no sense other than reading it in a dictionary. But I say, the events of the War of Independence and the 5th March events are known in the world. While promising service to us, we are told to take our freedom and be silent. Let go of fake animal lovers, free these beautiful animals. Let them sail in the deep seas, let them rebel as if to sing ??

Not finished. Where are you going? There are also pets. Animal lovers (so-called) keep the animals in apartments saying that we love animals for our children. No, they teach their little children about slavery and slavery rather than animal love. I wish the bears would put them in a cage and teach human love to their own offspring. Let's see how it feels. However, they can understand that way. I say this, I need another revolution. The concepts spread by the French Revolution have disappeared.

I want to talk about the murder of these so-called animal lovers living creatures is a crime, while I have repelled my anger with them. I am sure you will call it a coyote now. Isn't it good when eating kidney beans or a live? Now what happened? So-called animal lovers, I'm waiting for your answers.

36,"Stay away from me today ... If you have a mind ...
Smoke from my nose and ears, fire from my eyes ... Although I haven't had breakfast yet, what has happened since the morning has suppressed my hunger if I'm afraid .....

Again in the morning, I started to wait until it was full. It is like hell in the morning, both the traffic, the constantly full and narrowing time ... Fortunately, one of them - it would not stop - stopped and dropped passengers where I was waiting. I got in, took out my wallet, and since I had no coins left, I extended it for 20 TL. He started to be rumored, looking badly in the mirror, stopping in the middle of the road and lowered me on the grounds that he had no coins. Obviously he has no right to lower it, but the three-penny driver (not all of them, of course, but the sample I encountered this morning was really three pennies - or a maximum of 1 TL 75 kurus, because he lowered me because I did not give this money) ""go to the back to get a ride on a full truck"" Also, it means that other dolmus can give change, but there is a problem with this model.

Anyway, as the people living in Kadiköy, I think we have been accustomed to them for so many years that they go slowly when empty, they go fast when they are full, they do not drop passengers and block the road as soon as possible, two of them stand side by side and obstruct the road ...

It must be one of the examples of being disgraced with your money when I live in the morning, and here I send my best wishes to the driver who makes me feel bad as if he was on a full load without money ...

Anyway, I got on the ferry, I sat outside to calm down and get some air ... A fine arts student / or student island 3 girls are sitting next to me, seagulls, cormorants and storks at the breakwater ... I was overwhelmed with the conversations of the girls coming from the side while looking at one of the scenes of Istanbul that I will not get tired of seeing. .

""Oh vulture, look at the idiot, he's lost his way,"" he said, looking at a standing lady with her head close to her torso. My disbelief was confirmed by his friend right after him. ""Hah ha yes stupid vulture""

A few years ago, Barbaros Sansal was a guest on a television program, whoever you say, he is a fashion designer working with Yildirim Mayruk, and he is the assistant of Yildirim Bey. While talking about the fashion shows, he stated that he could not wear gloves on Turkish models because they lost time and disgraced them because they did not know how to remove them. Later, when we were having trouble with another fashion designer at a fashion show in France, the answer was, “We are fashion designer, we have been dressing for 300 years, but you are only a few 10 years… That's why your models have not been able to take off gloves.

Maybe it can be perceived as a humiliating discourse, but neither I nor anyone else can deny that the state we are in is ignorance, the one who denies has not read our history, that is, he is ignorant ....

While Mozart composes in Vienna, where we rely on our doors, while Women and Men are walking side by side with medieval clothes and hats, we turn the paintings inside the shadow of the Arab culture, we discard the art, we are in the emigration method of haremlik and we are in an illiterate family. A child who turns out to be an engineer is actually ignorant that he does not know that he will establish a family that can learn the etiquette he did not take when he said that he was no longer ignorant, but after 3-5 generations.

That is why you breathe the oxygen in the air together with many people who scatter terror in traffic, celebrate their victories with bullets, who do not know how to walk and eat, and who wipe their mouths with bread instead of napkins.

I'm angry, maybe I'm more sorry, but it's not getting better.",132.txt
37,"Dear Diary,
I am in the midst of extremely tense days.
The threshold that gave me strength now gives me tension, I don't understand.
When I first started to write, a discussion called ""why are you telling about your day, what is it?""
then it was said ""if the bankers stayed as bankers, why would they write?""
Now it's as if he's already so praised,
You will see that he will come to shit the creative writing thing.

Daily,
I also triggered my reader's sense of ""nekst pose"".
In fact, this feeling is often triggered in playgrounds.
Let's run and swing the swing, the brother came and let's go down,
Now let's get on the seesaw, now let's get off, let's go on the slide
-If the accident child falls into distraction ""I looked at you from the top of a slide, oh dear Istanbul ""-
""Look brother is waiting"" or ""Are we here to sit?""
I mean, an endless new position expectation with ""Kaysana Come On Kaysana"" s.

Junot Diaz wrote The Bizarre Short Life of Oscar Wao, which Pulitzer received, in seven years;
he also teaches creative writing at MIT.
Kiran also wrote his first novel in seven years and
Previously, although the author was a mother, y.y. involved in the incident.
With seven years, the creative writing thing exploded in my hand, is it okay?
Now I read, after seven years, is it a definitive novel, a simple novel?
either Pulitzer or Man Booker wait.
It has been four years and four months on bubenimhayatim.com before I can say ""This is my hand, this is my arm.""
Touches the tooth yet, what I wrote, I'm just getting hot.
The only advantage of this job is the delusion that ""the older you get, the better it will be"".
An ungrateful thing you already call prose; you are as good as your last article and as well ...
I forgot.
When you say seven years, it passes like water.

As if it was not enough that I took the responsibility of having a reader even though I am not a writer,
Now I said to the press, ""Come on, let's make an Emotion, do it and see!"" will be named as
new position expectation has emerged. I lay this expectation on your back,
Should I try to dodge it by spinning the ball between my feet?

Do you believe that nobody hurts the diary woman with a baby?
This is like military service. It happened to everyone once.
If you want to breathe a little, you have to come up with a good reason.
I was gruff inside me, I was cracked with curiosity and so on, but noble I was overwhelmed.
It was the result of such an annoyance, the cry ""Now is the time"".
One day of the week being able to leave Nil to my mother for four hours (she was asleep for two hours)
It was the best I could do, as there was no valid reason other than going to school by my mother.
Initially my mentor had offered to join the painting workshop together.
His offer, by gifting him the cup with the bas letter on it,
I gently put it off for another spring.

While trying to create a time zone of my own, it was not easy to leave the Nile.
I was always late for the class for twelve weeks, it didn't change once.
One time, I even entered the classroom from the balcony to break the routine, and it was good for all of us.
As the name suggests, ""power plant campus"" is possible from an architectural point of view.

There is no verbal, written, or opinionated or anything like that, but let it be!
On the first day, ""I am thirty years old, I have a daughter of one year old, I do not write a novel between my short and medium term plans,
I came here to take a breather too. But of course I have to write a storybook in my mind, ""I said.
Indeed, this desire started when I was pregnant and continued in intensity after Nil was born.
Because the fairy tale world needs some pruning.

But you know what am I noble for?
My mentor said at breakfast on the first day of the workshop:
""Keep a diary every day for 12 weeks, and then try to be a writer,
It is a story as the adventure of a young, single girl from Cihangir, who also attended a creative writing workshop.
150 pages is enough for you. ”He said!
He said exactly that and you ask me diary, what have I done: Nothing!
I did not even look in your face.
So what did Ayça Sen do: He wrote Hirs and Ceza.
Now do not let this turn to the ""Juggler was mine"" parody of Savas Ay.
I have plenty of ideas in my mentor.
I will necessarily sew one to the feet.
It didn't work, let me stop with open arms in an empty field, a counseling around me
I can find the money by building the office. I think this is also a very creative idea.
Now I feel like I am a very creative writer, have I relaxed myself a little bit of nervousness, what ...

The girl woke up diary.
It is not over yet, I could not set my feelings to my heart anyway,
wait, I'll write again tomorrow",133.txt
38,"They don't even look good together: (First of all, I'm very angry, sorry, bored, in a chaotic mood. But it's all about negative emotions. Everyone knows that this work will not remain limited to the university, but it is trying to ignore it by burying its head in the sand. Thank God some of them unwittingly voiced their opinions and declared their ultimate purpose. This has nothing to do with the right, the law, education and human freedom. This is all about changing the country's regime. Nobody should claim otherwise, everybody knows that it is a lie. Today, the university, tomorrow high school, then primary school, then babies like that 3-year-old girl on Wednesday.

Look, I read the Quran. It is written in only one sura and one verse that women should cover their jewelery places. Since when is our head a place of ornament. Moreover, I strongly agree with Latife Tekin's statement that if God wanted us to cover our hair, she would have made us bald. They empty religion and escape completely to formality and therefore try to polarize the people. Since when has secularism been irreligious? Have you not been able to practice your religion in this country for so many years and will you live now?

My dear primary school graduate father said the most beautiful yesterday: Men are trying to dominate them, and these girls are tools for them. They are worthy of such men then.

I wrote it many times, but I will write again. If you, as a woman, support a system that does not put you in a human position, regards you as a second class citizen and deprives you of all rights and freedoms, I have no words to say, you have read it for nothing. My dear fellow, you have only taught, not education, but not learned to work your head.

Do you think the event will stay with it. Let's take a look at the regime they want to bring you by making a table and see what you will lose. No, I wear the headscarf, but I also use the gains the Republic has given me. After all, you help people whose aim is to destroy the Republic. Nene Hatunlarin, you have the bones of Black Fatmas. They joined the War of Independence shoulder to shoulder with the men to bring us out of the darkness.

I am so full of anger, my anger has not passed, it cannot pass, to all of them. The RTE, the fuckers, the government, the MHP, which has partnered with RTE to raise its falling votes

May God bless our end.

Note: I closed this article to comment. I do not want to get into a polemic with anyone, this article is a complete inner pouring.",134.txt
39,"I'm so angry blog
 
Can't a person understand a sentence in half an hour? As soon as they do not understand, that kit wants to pull the event to another side with its mind and make you apprentice, obviously, when he makes a sentence in the language he will understand last time, he pauses. Well, crass, what did you do? I thought I was human for half an hour and told me. No, you insist on staying as an animal. I became worse animal!

the thing is, I never force the other party to do anything. Understands the moments I tell this as it is an official job. tells the requirements of a document and I do not click on the keyboard without the approval of the other party; Well, this crap both tickles the keyboard and puts the paper of the transaction that the man / citizen does not want to do on my desk! Look, look, look, look at the dork! man, yeh this is already started to write the article, I mean that even if I do not do the other process, I can take this document and go out before realizing that the thought may be generated; uh crass! again crass! I did not even rub my hand on the paper; The man was convinced and I wrote when he wanted to, I signed it. When the man left, it was my turn to tell this to the boob; Look, don't put this document on my desk again! Look, look at the answer; then I wouldn't work! I'm going to ask you if I'm going to work or not! I told you again; I told him that I would not force people to do anything, that he could do it well if he wanted it, but that he would never put paperbacks on my desk again in this manner, without using these words of crass and rambling. did not understand.

well enough that I consume so much breath; I said that if he does it again, I will forward the document to him with the citizen. I think he understood this language. he was silent. half an hour of my breath and my time; I drank 2 cigarettes and a tea on top of it, I still haven't calmed down, I want to throw the man down the window if he says one more word

In essence, I am very angry.

Vallahi is also very angry.

Sometimes I question who I wrote for what.

Write a message I say to myself, looking afterward, at least right now, there is nothing I can do, or anything else I do. I'm writing again.

I write again, even if I know I'm gonna knock it off again.

I'm very angry with the reaction, or the unresponsiveness. So belese, hazira is out of order.

He has given up thinking, questioning, researching so much, he has not shaken so much.

Vallahi also do not understand. I cannot understand these people. I do not realize how to continue living in this way.

I cannot understand how a person can live and breathe without questioning.

I do not understand you, him, the one next to you, bro. Even once ?? why ??? I cannot understand the human being.

In essence, I am very angry, but I never let it go. I close my eyes, bend my head, I sigh. I am shooting 42 movies at that moment in my head. Then I lift my head, open my eyes and look into those bombshell eyes.

Really, look really ?? I cannot understand neither you nor him.

In essence, I am very angry.

The renovation work is finally finished. Another 50 years will not break the street, I'm sure that, but when the work is finished in vino veritas did not open. The moment was frozen for me when I passed here on the way to class for the first time. Seeing this phrase on the sign pointed to very fresh pain. There was no more pain afterwards. I still wish I had opened and I would have gone. Maybe later I'll open a wine shop and name it in vino veritas. I'll cut the eye of anyone who stole my mind! because it is so original that nobody thought of it :)


I love audrey hepburn. not like that. very. No matter how much care a person may be, he cannot choose another body and soul instead of his own. I wouldn't say no if I ever come to the world again and it was with Audrey Hepburn's grace. I am convinced as well.


does people miss your mess? my life seems more full when scattered. It must be the volume of folded papers. like you're doing a lot. Planning the week, month, and months with a flipchart. to make a perpetual calendar and plan. feeling as you plan your own life. It doesn't matter if the plans are interrupted. I make so many plans that somebody comes true and what happens is fulfilling various functions such as making happy, entertaining, giving peace.

(d) im very fond of cooking. I haven't cooked anything for two months. not a good sign. And when you are outside, to make mantı, lentil meatballs, carnivore, bulgur pilaf / make it for the first time and be more satisfied with everything you have done so far. By the way, I would not dare to fall in love with mothers, mothers, grandmothers and aunts of the people you will taste these meals with. An Italian chef said, ""I was logical once in Turkey. Every customer commented that my mother's, my aunt's, my mother's is more beautiful, intervened."" he. ravioli, stuffed leaves .. these are sensitive issues.

On the outside, it would be wanting someone you love to discover a taste you love very much. If I love a person, I have cooked for him, offered to do it, wanted to do it, or at least I felt like it.
It is already a heavy burden to do what I learned here last year as soon as possible.

Complain about smoking in the cheesy of those who have fought with smoke for years (very hysterical ways of fighting sorry, pushing me). then just enjoy yourself with your coffee. This habit is only in question if smoking is slim. I know there are a lot of people like that :) my difference is that it only applies there and then.
and now it's time to confess
When there were 4 people in the house and the other three (including me!) were non smokers, poor fourth always drank on the balcony in freezing weather. We started smoking after he left. carrying the table to the kitchen, accompanied by coffee, chocolate fondue and fortune telling. After all, there was no one to smoke all the time. a drinker who will find this habit of ours!
it was sheer rudeness.


A place with chestnut kebab on the street feels like home. No matter how far you are from where you have seen yourself as home for as long as you can remember. Okay, if it can't feel like home, let's say it feels a little belonging.

Belonging to chestnut is an impossibility in raclette under the current conditions! My mother won't let me smell the house like that in life. Both the raclette mother's house and not the student's house is for a single room (no single room!). I don't want to think how the supermarkets that sell a bite of gouda for 15-20 YTL, have already flown in raclette. delicatessens, on the other hand, speak from a completely different financial dimension. And forget it, I don't have a raclette grill!

And if there is a cook ... Who will come to your aid, I am on the road but I do not. In my depressed days, I would like to lie down and lie alone, without responsibility ... Who leaves alone with yourself. My daughter has been whimpering on my head, and has been whining all the time lately. When he moved to a new house and started daycare, I don't know him anymore. That cute, self-sufficient, beautiful girl who thought she didn't know how to cry went away, and a grumpy, crying girl came. I had learned the books. I assume that it is a temporary period and try to move on with my life. Work fatigue, road fatigue, waiting jobs at home, a child and spouse I need to take care of ... My daughter is also sick, every morning and night at the beginning. I can't remember what it was like to sleep. I checked my memory but no information came in :)) Oooooof offfff I want to be alone, without even moving my finger. Whenever there is something new in my life, I am like this, am I crazy or what am I? I think I have to take a serious step and find the reason for this and overcome it. I also want to live an ordinary life and deal with daily sorrows and joys. My wife says ""you need a format"", I think he is right. I wonder if I go to my childhood, maybe I will solve the problem :)) It happened years ago, traces of upbringing mistakes are carried to these ages and we encounter them everywhere. That is why I sometimes get tired of raising my daughter so that I don't make mistakes or minimize it. Maybe that's wrong too, it shouldn't be that hard ... ""Love"" is the magic word I guess.

My father went early, but I needed him more ... I want him to be with me in every difficult moment so much that it hurts to my bone marrow. I am always half missing, and I know it will not be complete. It does not turn into ashes, whatever pain this pain is, my goal is not to upset you more, but I just wanted to pour out my heart ...

I understand you so well, do you know what's wrong with being a Capricorn? We get our share. We start questioning life immediately and we go into unhappiness syndrome. I understand from the summer that I will experience this minor depression again these months. I've always had depression in these months for many years, no wonder, but it will pass, WAIT DAY OF BIRTH, and meditation is perfect for us ...

48,"This tiredness is destroying me. Am I like this? Am I always tired, tired, unhappy?
There is no happy person among my colleagues. Nobody says that I am going home, enjoying life, watching television, having fun, going to the movies. Today, a friend's mother, Esra, gets tired very quickly, there is a problem here, she said. We four of us said in unison, we said too.
There is a problem here.
I live and leave with people who have no expectations from life, without any expectations from life. Days do not bring me anything. The days take me away, quickly, tiredly, quickly. Days pass. My baby is growing. I can not notice. Because pessimism made a gray curtain before my eyes, I cannot break it.
Every now and then, I cannot maintain my life energy, which I barely acquired. The bad things I keep saying that I am tired, exhausted, unhappy hang in the universe, turn around and come back to me, hitting me in the face from the universe and staggering me. I was tired of constantly staggering, my back ached.

I lost my sleep, I wake up many times during the night. I turn from right to left and sleep back. Sometimes I can't sleep. I turn back right back left back right back left. It is morning.

I eat excessively, I gain weight, but it is not a solution.

I can diagnose minor depression if I push myself a bit.

Sixteen years ago someone told me you have a negative energy. During these sixteen years, I tried to get rid of this and couldn't succeed. But last week I found the reason for this negative energy. I am because I pour inside out. Sometimes I am less happy, sometimes calm and sometimes I am low on energy, but I immediately throw it out and reflect it. Thus, from the fluctuations inside me, the outside also fluctuates.

Exactly fourteen years ago, a friend of mine, whom I still love very much, said that my soul was caught in a storm and shaken. I said when to stop. He didn't know. Mine is shaking too. When to settle down, I asked a psychiatrist that I went to nine years ago to see if I could cure it when I was really depressed. He said you can settle down at the age of 35. I said why. Capricorn signs were shaken up to the age of 35. The psychiatrist was also a capricorn. I cannot accept you as a patient because he said that if you have a doctor, you will think you are sick and you cannot recover.
Actually, I knew that the energy to heal myself was hidden inside me. I just didn't know how to reveal it. That's why I started to meditate.
It did a lot of work. It was the most important step I took in my life. (I can't now why?) It was past. It was me again. I had been positive. I had been strong. I was beautiful. My confidence was back.
I can't do it now. I was 24 years old then. Am I old now?

I am very afraid of injustices. When my father got sick, I thought I was subjected to great injustice (why should life be fair?). Actually, I was doing the wrong thing because it was my father who was actually wronged. We didn't even tell him about his illness. Well, if he was sick and died at that young age, I keep asking myself why I was still being wronged and not understanding why my father died early? I haven't been able to recover since my father died. Bad things hadn't happened to me until that day. When you asked if you were going to see this place again, when you asked if you were going to see this place again, when you were on your last crossing from Galata Bridge, we said, of course, we will come here and go fishing. It's been two years, dad, how quickly has it passed? Look, Damla was in me, now he's big, soon he will be a sister, do you see us from there, dad?

Why do I think life is full of injustices? (Nobody should say you have everything, do not be ungrateful, yes I have everything, my health, my family, a good job, my salary ... Yes, thank God. laylay lom home, my work, my family, I can't say how happy I am). Please don't get angry anymore .. Always others are angry. Others always get angry with me, what I did or couldn't do. My mother, my husband, my friends. Everyone gets angry.

There are no people I love exactly, my friends are among those I said. Is this from me too? I see, when I love someone exactly, I see that he doesn't really love me! However, I also need it, I love you no matter what you do, never mind your energy, nobody says this is the thing to accept. Come never mind hanging face saying that all passes. Everybody says come to me happy, don't come so sad when you are done with your face. Dimple and Taschi would put up with me, I guess, one thousand and one three thousand kilometers away. I need friends who can stand up to me anyway, otherwise I cannot get back out of me. I can no longer be happy. Five days a week my energy is at the bottom, I cannot be smiling even two days. Smiling face. I can't smile. To nobody. To none. Also in the mirror. I can't make up. I can't wear my top properly. Fatoş, where are you, how far this America is, come remind me to smile. Your father was sick too, but you have no right to appear unhappy, you would say that this is my own problem and smile at us again. Fatoş I haven't smiled since my father died, you know? But I cry almost every day. Fatoş I wish you could hear me.

I forgot to smile.",143.txt
49,"I am openly annoyed with the black market system.

The tickets that went on sale at 10.00 were over before 11.00 and before I could go to the box office. Of course, there were also black market people waiting for those who could not find tickets at the box office. Moreover, they were chatting with the Biletix officers. I will buy the 100 YTL ticket for 200 YTL now.

And while putting a difference of 100 ytl, he said, ""Oh, my son is in the same school with you and his name is also hede hödö, do you know?"" does not try to establish a hot conversation by saying. Come and don't be nervous ...",144.txt

If anyone thinks about something like ""a man doesn't change a barber"", stop reading right here. changes. my barber had a tumultuous life. the guy with whom I always run the shop, which I call stormy, would change, the shop would change, etc. anyway. but I would always go to that guy, shave him. Naturally, there is nothing more normal than chatting with him. If I go to a barber for the first time, I expect the same interest and attention from the barber so that I can see that he is trying to become my new barber. but conversation with the man sitting next to me on bus rides is a different thing. Actually, at first glance, there seems to be no difference between talking to a barber who was visited for the first time and talking to the man sitting next door on the bus ride. always the same entries: ""where are you from, how far are you going, how is your school etc."". However, as I said, while there is continuity in the barber, there is no such continuity in the man sitting next to the bus ride. However, they are more sincere than barbers.

I'm going to my house one night by bus. The man sitting next to me is obviously bored, asking the classic questions as I got on. Later, when he found out where I studied, he said: ""I took the exam result document to the home of your school graduate who got a degree in OSS. I am the postman."" ""So banane?"" to say, of course, it will be slow. but there is no need for this sincerity. I'm not even talking about aunts. They can't sit next to me because of the gender difference, but their conversations can be heard even from afar. When they get off the bus, they send off their travel companions, saying, ""Come to us too, we will wait."" I wonder if anyone has ever been to such an invitation on the bus. I think that aunt opens the door and does not recognize her bus friend.

Of course, there is a reason why I wrote them. I was on the bus again today. The assistant came to us while we were driving around asking what we would like for the service. I wanted one passion biscuit. While the chatter next to me was saying, ""Only one of these is 500 calories. I think don't eat it. Look, you are out of your belly."" said. man what is this sincerity? my barber tells me ""oh, angry, the hairs on your neck are going down to the back"". I am sincere with him. but I'm not with you

I am so happy and delighted; Even the underdeveloped team, who could not get rid of adolescence but tried to get rid of their depression, stepped into adolescence with the presence of a brain and hormone that was too incapable of being depressed, and still struggling to fall into depression even after years passed from adolescence cannot disturb my nerves.

 

Admiring potentials, who think that Turkey's intellectual snobs are really bucks, are open to their efforts to be like them when they grow up, no matter how many writer-poet candidates whose names are just starting to be heard in the circle of friends, to read their absurdities before they come out to the vision, and their efforts are open at every opportunity. when they do, even that upward movement that I am used to feeling in my stomach does not occur.

 

Realizing that they will never get to the position of the ""big man"" they are aiming for in life according to their own capacities, some of those who have gathered their age a little more ?? hey, respect me, although I also feel that I am not a creature to be respected, the denyo whom I am trying to resemble is one that will be very respected? ? It never scratches the nerve endings in the disgust center of my brain.

 

Those who liken the strangeness that arise because they only strained their inventive capacities to the suffering it inflicted on them, look around after this abrasive effort and do not like what he makes, but even those brown voices that they miss while struggling in situations that do not understand what they have read cannot cut my appetite.

 

The poor ones who are trying to explain the insurrectional urges of growing up in a bombshell environment and still realizing that it is the bottom layer of the place, trying to push them to the outside world where they see cotton candy, and who suffer from being that strange and contradictory scope of nothingness, cannot spoil my joy either.

 

When they grow up, the baby pissing on the gas tank and the rear window of the Falcon-looking Falcon ?? It does not worry me at all about the bourgeois-aspiring prolemagandas, who will stick the sticker, appear and have a selection of minibus literature and then disappear forever, where they disappear, and at what point in my life they should not be.

 

This ?? despicable society ?? ?? from his worthless judgments ?? Some big heads dislike him, grimacing as if he heard every word spoken for the thousandth time, pouring out the pear rot ideas shining brightly under the arrogant and absurd value judgments to make us see his grimaced faces do not kick my right foot today. .

 

Cock hormone balances ?? a brick coming towards your head ?? and ""what right do you have to warn the brick because it is coming right in my head?"" It feels like a simple pleasure today to even imagine the bells sound when the brick hits the head.

In fact, with constipated people who tear one of their kind sides to come up with stupid ideas just to be original, and then think that everyone is trying to produce the same stupid products and their gentle sides are ripped off, google to make sure that the phrases they have taken off from books and leaflets by scrapping copy-paste agents are not available on the Internet? I do not feel disgusted today even from the annoyances who received the best user award from or who added words and phrases as an additional precaution to every sentence he executed.

 

In fact, in addition to all of this, it doesn't feel uncomfortable to even smell the presence of sacks that need to relieve diarrhea by straining their intestines and relaxing around here and everywhere, rather than saying, more than words.

53,"Our title was a bit general, but it was clean :) .. Friends, programming is a tool that has been started to be used to facilitate the current work and carry them on the click. Such a tool should show the same smiling face to the programmer, it also shows. For example, 10 times when the user wants to read 1 each of 10 students. If we were to use the read command, it would be cruel, which is why repetitive operations are done in cycles.

A loop is a structure that continues the process inside it to a standstill. In this case, we have to divide the loops into two; Loops with and without a certain number of steps.Misal we talked about reading the grade of 10 students above. As you can see, the number of steps of this process is read in 10 stages.
For i: = 1 to n do. I have written the non-mold sides of this in bold. You can say that there is no pattern here. :) Well there i is the initial variable i does not have to be i, it can be j. 1 is the initial value it is 2 3 etc. may be. ?? to ?? It indicates the increment, that is, starting from 1 ?? as long as we do not reach n ??, the value of i ?? is increased by 1, this can be down to, it decreases the value by 1 and 1, and N is the stopping point.

To sum up, the loop starting from the value of the initial variable indicated with i, after completing the operations in it, increases its value by one and checks whether it reaches N ?? When it reaches N, it enters the loop for the last time. When it reaches N it does not go away, this is the feature of the for loop.

In the figure above, we see an example that finds any power of a number in the grades of the YTU BBG-1 course, which I did not make any special effort, I wanted to mention that it is a quotation before I tell it. As we can see, we read from the user two variables, number and strength. Our value variable is the variable we are going to return and we have assigned 1 at the beginning of the program. This assignment of 1 may seem unnecessary at the moment, but in the later stages, if the ""value"" is used before in a program consisting of many more lines, it may be processed information and we must change it to 1. Then we see the way the for loop is expressed in the diagram. Here i »1 says that i starts at 1, the 1 right next to the ratio; 1er increases by 1er, and the lower ""force"" indicates that the loop will perform the operation within it, up to the value of the force variable. For example, while calculating the 3 prime 4, the inside operation takes place as value = value * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27 * 3 = 81. ;



For those of you who do not know (or think you know), I will explain it as follows. Maybe you will wonder and take a look? If a concept called the Republic of Turkey still exists today, it is only because we eat the crops of the saplings grown by those institutes. So it's because we are running out of stocks, not because we are eating new crops ?? ..

These institutions, which used coeducation (male and female students' education together) and applied it to the peasant youth, are the only reason why these institutions raise communists. You know, they were closed on the grounds.

However, they are on the wrists of the saplings, for which they have given a teaching diploma; On the one hand, they wore gold bracelets such as carpenters, ironmongers, farmers, tailors, cooks, musicians, and theater actors. The great leader Mustafa Kemal ?? s ?? the Peasant is the Lord of the Nation ?? they gave graduates worthy of his word.

They were offended to those institutions ?? They dried the bottom of those saplings. Because they knew that those saplings will always be a stumbling block to them. It will open the eyes of the ignorant people. It will keep the secular Republic above all else. Who does not sell his country, does not sell, loves more than his life, on the way of Ata ?? I would die if necessary ?? Saying how many saplings will grow ?? He did not come to these works, they took care of those institutions ??

I remember this every November 24 .. These institutions, where my grandfather, grandfather, grandmother was raised, what they told me, I remember the love of the Republic and education that shines in their eyes even at the age of 80.

Then my mother and father, who are their children, come to my mind. I remember their struggle day and night for this sacred profession they inherited, almost like an inheritance. Despite all the obstacles they encounter, I remember their hopes, their respect for their profession, their eyes shining when talking about their students, without distinguishing them from their own children?

I am a teacher child, a teacher grandson ..

In the last 60 years, I have lived and lived through all the stages of this sacred profession in my 24-year life in this country.

Looking at the situation now, this sacred profession is ?? a profession of choice ?? When I saw those who made it, ""nothing could happen, at least let me be a teacher and lean on the state ?? When I think about the people who enter the profession, I feel sad, saddened ??

That's why today, hold tightly at least one teacher's hand, kiss, smell ?? Those hands are too sacred to be left because ??

I congratulate all the teachers who are devoted to their profession, especially the head teacher Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the teachers' day with my sincere respect.",17.txt
54,"Once upon a time, there was a farmer living in the Chinese town of Fenghuang. The farmer was engaged in planting and planting in the vast land in front of his house, selling the crops he obtained and earning a living for his family.

Three of the farmer's 4 children were male. But none of them like to work, and they walk around from morning to evening. As the farmer began to age, he could not deal with the field. As the day passed, the income of the family has decreased. Despite this situation, the children continued not to work.

As time went on, as time went on, the farmer could no longer get out of bed. He also got a serious illness. The farmer, realizing that the time allotted to him in this world is over now, has gathered his children for the last time before he died. My children, I have a secret that I have kept from you for so many years. There is a gold burial under our field. After I die, dig the field and find the gold and spend it as you please ?? He said, and without worries, he closed his eyes to life.

The children rushed into the field with great enthusiasm and turned it all over. They could not find any gold, but they ensured that their land, which had not been cultivated for a long time, came to him. While they were excavated, they decided to do what their father did and cultivate the land. Soil yielded more crops that year than it had before, and the children earned more money than they had ever seen before.

??

This story tells a lot. Burning with the dream of gold, the children dug the field. However, there was no gold. However, life somehow rewarded their effort and desire, and even if they could not find the gold, it allowed them to earn more money than they could ever see in their lives.
Everything ends with the person himself. It ends with believing, trusting, desiring, wanting, and finally working and striving for it. Today, whenever I see someone around me complaining about not being rewarded for their actions, two things always come to my mind. Either they don't show enough patience or they don't put in enough effort.

Success, on the other hand, is hidden within the human being. A person can achieve success to the extent that he can turn inside and question.

So if we want to make our dreams come true, let's ask ourselves right now, how long we are and how eager we are for it. If something is moving inside of us, is it time to act?

56,"This has been the most popular subject of recent days, being a child nowadays, being a child in these times is a word and so on. Probably, after the groups on facebook, they muttered more.

Yes, we are people who lived our childhood in the late 80s and early 90s (I was born in 1984: D). They were good days. Advertisements, television shows, cartoons, games we played on the streets, teasers, kidnappers, summers-winters-girls: D We were happy back then. And now we say we wish we were in those times, we were kids at that time ??

But many of us are skipping that a child is always a child. He was a kid in the 670s, in the 1900s, in the 2000s ?? As a matter of my job, most of the social part of my day is spent with children. I take great pleasure in observing them; because in this world where there is a ton of problems, they don't have any problems. Their only concern is to have fun, laugh, play, fight each other ?? Everything is fine for them ??

Sometimes we talk about the television shows they watched in class. They all watch the TV series I hate the most with great pleasure (no matter how much I banned: D). They count cartoons in such a way that it's the first time I've heard their names in my life. In the meantime, those cartoons come across on TV and are they watched? Where I say cartoons in our time; but they admire those cartoons. Because they're kids and unfortunately I'm grown up ?? And in the 2030s, they will open groups on bilemnebook.com in the early 2000s to become a child at the end of 2010, and they will criticize their children.

As people get older, their dreams get shallower. Now they have certain goals. I think what I wouldn't want to happen when I was a kid? Pehhh ?? Now there is nothing but 2-3 goals! Good things about them ??

Being a child is such a thing that I want to tell, but I can't because I grew up. I wish I had written what it meant to me to be a child when I was 5-10 years old and read and smile today; but I don't know if I still have pure feelings of that time. The world was clean then and now ??

Can I describe being a child in a few lines?

Being a child is laughing,
To be a child is to cry,
Being a child is being fearless,
Being a child is actually being afraid of everything,
To be a child is to laugh when everyone is crying, to cry when everyone is laughing,
To be a child is to lie; but the powdery lies ??
Being a child means not wanting to ever grow up?
I wish it becomes real??

Why did I write? How should I know?? Maybe it's because I want to be a child.",2.txt

because the lives of people who react like that now have become msn. They martyr your soldiers, you sit down and put a bowed rose on the head of your msn nickname for reaction. No, it is not about respect for martyrs. The point is that these types really see this reaction as a ""reaction"".

I'm chatting with two friends, one of them starts sending classic message: ""Please write (you think) to the beginning of your nick, let's arm sign, let's show our reaction"". the other men that man sent this deer to are also on my list. If ten of them take it seriously, my msn sings ten times. Send alerts popping out from the bottom right.

I'm tired bro. if you react, get out of the street. Leave me alone in msn messenger-windows live messenger, where I can only communicate with people.

59,"I wrote down what I think of the barbers. Do not say what this entry has to do with the bus now. I don't like the conversation of the man sitting next to me on the bus as much as I love conversations in barbers. I will also explain why I do not like it through the barbers.

If anyone thinks about something like ""a man doesn't change a barber"", stop reading right here. changes. my barber had a tumultuous life. the guy with whom I always run the shop, which I call stormy, would change, the shop would change, etc. anyway. but I would always go to that guy, shave him. Naturally, there is nothing more normal than chatting with him. If I go to a barber for the first time, I expect the same interest and attention from the barber so that I can see that he is trying to become my new barber. but conversation with the man sitting next to me on bus rides is a different thing. Actually, at first glance, there seems to be no difference between talking to a barber who was visited for the first time and talking to the man sitting next door on the bus ride. always the same entries: ""where are you from, how far are you going, how is your school etc."". However, as I said, while there is continuity in the barber, there is no such continuity in the man sitting next to the bus ride. However, they are more sincere than barbers.

I'm going to my house one night by bus. The man sitting next to me is obviously bored, asking the classic questions as I got on. Later, when he found out where I studied, he said: ""I took the exam result document to the home of your school graduate who got a degree in OSS. I am the postman."" ""So banane?"" to say, of course, it will be slow. but there is no need for this sincerity. I'm not even talking about aunts. They can't sit next to me because of the gender difference, but their conversations can be heard even from afar. When they get off the bus, they send off their travel companions, saying, ""Come to us too, we will wait."" I wonder if anyone has ever been to such an invitation on the bus. I think that aunt opens the door and does not recognize her bus friend.

Of course, there is a reason why I wrote them. I was on the bus again today. The assistant came to us while we were driving around asking what we would like for the service. I wanted one passion biscuit. While the chatter next to me was saying, ""Only one of these is 500 calories. I think don't eat it. Look, you are out of your belly."" said. man what is this sincerity? my barber tells me ""oh, angry, the hairs on your neck are going down to the back"". I am sincere with him. But I'm not with you, why are you saying that, you make me angry.

note1: I don't have any problem with my belly. the man you call must be a hundred kilos.

Note2: evil bus. nice picture.

I agree with you one hundred percent. It happened to me once too. I am going to Kırklareli for business for the first time from Istanbul. Next to me was a man a little older than me (25-26 years old). He is constantly asking questions, telling about his own experiences. I say you will end up inside, sleep or something, but in vain. No, the man you do not know gets hairy and scratches when you chat like your military friend. By the way, my first visit to your blog, I liked it, I even subscribed. Achievements...

I'd be hurrying to write something, like when I'm on the phone, I have to write something down. I can hardly reach the pen holder, I hurry to take one, and it comes out as soon as I write. is a nervous situation. but that pen is indispensable, the right hope is sarikaya.

For me, there were always dead batteries in pencil cases as well as non-writing pens. but I wouldn't be nervous with dead batteries. I wouldn't bite to use it for another five minutes. my understanding of entertainment was very different.

I used to buy all kinds of batteries. I would arrange the same sized ones side by side. then I would race the batteries by blowing them. yes, i would do that. I would do my own elimination, and I would describe the races as an announcer. Red maxell batteries have always been my favorite, I would make them first by blowing too much. There was there and it was good too, as if there was not much duracell in those days. If it were, it would be my favorite, but the challenge was left to maxell batteries.

Even though it is irrelevant, talking about them gives the air of ""I know this, too"" to the other person. ""Yes, I read dozens of blogs one day I came across a site like this one day on one of those blogs,"" I begin to explain in a very cool way.

Anyway, I saw the Chii Let's draw website on the blog There was such a thing called isketch (damn, what do I know), is it doing the same thing as this site I don't know because I haven't been able to get it through yet because I got annoyed while trying to sign up.

I bought my first computer about 10 years ago. There was mirc at that time. It would not be possible not to enter, not to chat, but what would be the nickname when you entered? my uncle was at home at that time, he found a suitable name, and I have used it ever since. It is my first choice when it comes to registering on any site. But come and see that I cannot register with this nickname. What is it sir, the nickname is registered in the system. Who uses it but me? so many years, I haven't met a Turkish child using my nickname on the internet. Okay, I would have problems registering on foreign sites, because they would use it. For example, when I searched for my nickname in icq, it used to produce 8-10 results (there was icq or not?). It is also annoying that these sites put silly idiotic numbers next to them (see nervousdam17) and provide me with new suggestions. No, I do not want a nickname with meaningless numbers (sometimes meaningful but still unnecessary. See previous example such as date of birth or license plate code) next to it. I want something that I use, that I am used to. Then there is a mess of course, ""Man, by what name did I sign up for this site?"" one has to think.

From now on, every time I try to go to the internet, I will wait to see whoever goes to this scratch site and uses my nickname. I'll finish it.

I don't live in a very big city. But let's see that while too many people should not be driving in this tiny country, cars are overflowing from its narrow streets. I do not live in the city either, I am in a small town. I find it difficult to find parking spaces for the car on every recreational or compulsory trip from town to city. The few tiny parking spaces are full, only bus stops are empty on the sidewalks. Leaving the car somewhere unrelated to my destination and doing my work on foot makes me nervous. Moreover, if this city is very hot in summers and very windy in winters, I cannot afford it, I am terribly angry.

I felt like I got angry with the place where I live, but not with the people. tiny place anyway. If I am not coming from town, I will not drive in that city. you don't use it too bro. there is a bicycle.

We strive to raise the awareness of students who are candidates to become the architects of informatics and technology and prepare them for a better tomorrow.As Yıldız Technical University Information Technology Club, we held our first big event this year, the 8th Information Days in Yıldız Technical University Auditorium Hall on 12-13-14 November 2008. . In addition to the industry's leading companies and university students, high school students who are considering a career in this sector also attended the event.

On the first day of the event, Vadi DİPÇİN from Turkcell, What Awaits Us in Mobile World? starting with the session of Turkcell Teknoloji, Verda EMİROĞLU ??? continued with the session. The afternoon sessions started with the Oracle session of Bilginç IT Academi. Later, Daron METHOD closed half (: P) of the event with Silverlight 2.0 and WPF sessions. Is a person so energetic and always rushing somewhere and telling something without getting bored. I really appreciate you teacher .. :)

Our 2nd day ?? How to Set Up Your Own Internet Company While Studying at University ??? under the theme Burak BÜYÜKDEMİR ?? etohum.com * Aydonat ATASEVER ?? cimri.com * October KAYA ?? botego.com * Alemşah ÖZTÜRK ?? 41-29 * Kudret ÇUREY ?? alisverissaati.com and * Murat BUYURGAN ?? in ?? It was realized with the participation of Kurumsalhaberler.com, but your friends
It started with the session they called etohum session :) At that time, you are not in the Circuit Theory exam, sir, no super position, I could not take part in the session because I brainstormed thevenin, norton, alexander akus devretus. While I couldn't find the opportunity to participate in other places, I couldn't attend this session. It is interesting that this lesson was not even in my life at that time :), participation in an organization that I have been interested in since its preparation was dropped thanks to this exam, but it was still good .. The other session is ?? new technologies ?? with the participation of PC Magazine News Manager Cem Sünbül and Game Editor Murat Oktay, whom we call the name but who are in a conversation about informatics in general. It was a really enjoyable session, I could listen for a few more hours :) In this session, I asked myself whether the old days were better. It must be high school-1 times, maybe a little later, I watch the hardware presentations in Slikon Valley on TV, I have generally seen Cem Sünbül in the episode where Ecevit Bıktım ?? At that time, it had been 4 years since I started dealing with hardware, so I entered this world in the 5th grade :), while watching the program, I said I wish I would introduce the equipment as well, I said that if I could meet one day, I was bored with Sünbül. If I introduce it, I have already turned the topic of my blog to hardware promotion and I think I introduced the Antec Phantom fanless power supply first :). Now when I saw Cem Sünbül in front of me, I asked myself if the excitement of his desire to see it at that time, was childhood or something moving yet! :) I feel as if I am talking about something like processor, I am looking for the excitement of the first days. Let's not go in too blog mood just because we are blogging. After the PC Magazine session, we gave a place to Gigabyte's PC collection training, and this session, which we aimed to get participation from outside, reached its goal. It made me very happy that some high schools came privately. The second day of our event ended with Pardus sessions. Ozgurlukicin.com team has been with us for a long time with sessions where they talked about software development and community processes with Pardus 2008.1, Pardus. If the auditorium hadn't really closed, they would talk to the last audience :). I thank all of them.

Our 3rd day started with the session of Crea Academy Ericsson. I did not see my own number in so many draws I did for 2 days, but it was strange to see 13 when I pressed enter after I invited one of the speakers to compile my program on the computer according to the last number and press enter on the morning of the 3rd day. It was more weird to turn to the microphone and say 13 first and then say aa 13 mine, and it was even stranger that the participants did not empty the hall when I got the phone :) For a moment I thought they were thinking they were just a joke. The last day of our event continued with the Developer Network session of Volkan BİÇER from Yahoo. Then there was the session of the Informatics Platform, in which we took part as YTU Informatics Club, and I plan to write more on the Informatics Platform in the future.

We made our closing on Friday with the Stand-Up show of Alpay ERDEM from Penguin and it was a different closing. I hope from now on, we can realize the Information Days in a better way by adding flavor to it.",3.txt

Because when you search for the subject of writing elsewhere, you are no different from the strange looking for a needle in a haystack. While I was thinking about what to write tonight, Nesli ?? e ?? I said, he goes right foot ?? What would a person be happy with? write this.?? said. Why did you want that, my buddy, are you unhappy? Are you looking for my happiness? Don't be sad, here you are. :) Actually, you are a master at this job. ;)

In fact, this thing that is sought after is not something that is barely found. Everything is very simple in life anyway; but knowing to look, wanting to do is important. When I look at my past like this, I can say that I am 90 happy, 5 still, 5 in 3 gaps, 2 unhappy. Maybe most people haven't even seen that & percnt; 2, maybe it & percnt; 2 is actually & percnt; 22 with what I've experienced inside; However, the rate is very low in my heart because I have never worried or tried to wear it.

How is this work? Some actually call it polyannism, some are vagrants, some are malevolent. But I say looking positive. Don't make things big, even if you get angry or mad, wipe them out of your brain in the short term or hit jokes.

This is actually that simple. But the real thing is that it can do that. He believes he can do this. Doesn't it all start with believing anyway? If you don't have faith, the X is in the upper right corner, the bread knife is on the counter in the kitchen. ;) So, did not it happen, you were going to talk about happiness, Doğan! You went to death, suicide, are you crazy? I'm not too smart anyway, don't ask this question much. If you want to be happy anyway, be a little crazy. What did they say, I would be clever and be crazy that I will suffer the world? :D

Anyway, let's not distribute the subject too much, let's not be silly, let's not be Ajdar. :D

A person can be happy with everything, sound a little hedonistic; but there is no need to exaggerate that much. One has to know what he wants, or what life can give him. Everything starts with knowing yourself, if you know yourself, know your competencies, know your skills, know what you want, if you can send me 1000 TL per month for good, you can be perfectly happy. :D

The questions can sometimes be difficult, and one can look for difficult answers to these difficult questions. This is a mistake for me. Because the answer to the hardest question is actually the simplest. As I keep repeating. You can be happy by not looking at things complicated, assimilating, sometimes laughing, sometimes cursing ??

They asked Abidin Dino, Abidoş, can you draw a picture of happiness for us? You said shame, am I going to offend you? And seated drew:

It is beautifully drawn, beautiful and simple. This is actually the answer to the question. How can we be happy?

First, you will boil the cauliflowers for 15 minutes over high heat. Then you will wash it off with cold water.

“It's a very nice feeling. 35 years ago, we became champions with the name of IETT. I was a player in the championship back then. That is why we are very happy to have reached this championship.

'' We are a team that plays a team game. I tried hard until I did this. I don't want it to be a single person system. We will build a few reinforcements on this team and prepare well for the Champions League. In volleyball, it is necessary to bring Turkey to a good place in the Men's Champions League. Our goal is to play the final of four. It is very difficult, but as Istanbul Büyükşehir Belediyespor, we will come out of it. ''

Özbey also stated that the championship they won is an indication of the services of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality to amateur branches.",5.txt

Just a year ago, you left me
I was full and overflowing, I was in trouble
Saying that you are poor, not with you;
I'm sorry now that you left me.

I loved you the way you are
I said there is no yacht on my floor
I gave this loving heart to you
My heart is not enough, now I am sorry.

More than me you loved money
You said I don't believe in happiness without it
Then you gave your heart to the rich
Your face wasn't laughing, now I'm sorry.

You couldn't get me out of that heart
You couldn't find the love you were looking for
Happiness with your money you couldn't get it
You regretted it very much, now I'm sorry.

Pages full of hell you wrote
You built the gallows, hanged the halter
Your fault is your fault, now I'm sorry",51.txt

I am good, may God give patience to my friend and family, but I hope he will not go as far as divorce. Meeting you really made me very happy.

How many taverns I wandered tonight I forgot
How many glasses I drank from the sorrowful wines
How many times have I sworn not to drink again
How many times did I get drunk tonight, I forgot it too

Such a mad love would not have come to my mind
I couldn't take myself out of the pubs
I found myself in the morning at your door every night
I forgot myself thinking of you

Day and night mingled with each other, I couldn't choose
I made spring winter, never understood that the months passed
I fell in love with you like a lilac
I'm tired of drinking and loving

How many taverns I wandered tonight I forgot
I don't remember how many times I've been stacked on the tables
I see you in dreams, I dream of you
I'm burning with the fire of love in me

Every day he is distancing himself from Atatürk's Turkey, national feelings and homeland perver,
One step closer to his submission to his foreign admiration and hegemony,
We are faced with an Ataturk's Turkey, where the Nation State, the Secular Republic, the Contemporary Law have lost.
Where is the spirit of Çanakkale, where is the struggle for independence, where is the holy homeland where the National Pact was drawn with tears of blood
Under the guise of democracy, fascism is in demand, the right to the law and the trust in justice are decreasing day by day.
The image of the rich, the rich poorer, the stronger is getting stronger, and laws are made according to individuals.

Cults Congregations are taken as reference, contemporary modern education is bleeding

The Quran says the following: ?? ... Some of you should not backbite others and rush behind you. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Here are you disgusted and disgusted by it ... ?? (13) ?? Woe to every person who tugs at the back and makes fun of his eyebrow-eye movements! (14)

SAY DELETE EMPTY YOUR BRAIN ... I KNOW VERY GOOD. BOTH ARE PROUD, PROUD AND PERSONAL FRIENDS ... Believe me, I lived in a strange sadness because of what I read and what happened ... this is the sharing site yahuuu information friendship friendship people share ... what is the job of their private life here !!! CADIM Why do you take what the people you do not value say on your valuable people and you are sorry .. Do not you know that as you take it on you, you will gain value and you will tire your head .. do not value inferences, my witch ... we know that my Lord is great .. ! since when has the dry scum stuck to the wall !!!!!! when !!! I met you, Taniyali ... I say I love this CADIYII :) You can understand from his speech? They say there is a way from heart to heart. If we say this by changing it a little more: ~ There is a way from language to heart ~ The speech of soft-hearted people is also soft and moderate. They never break heart. Because there is a touchstone in the heart; He measures his words first and then presents them to his interlocutor. A good word turns the darkness in our hearts into daylight even when we are angry. ""A war of words, a word of love, a word of love, a word of love, a word of oil and honey."" Hard-hearted people have lost this hitch. As soon as it happens, he speaks, either breaks his head or makes an eye. Look, in this regard, Hz. What does Omar say: O Kaaba! If I wash you a thousand times, I can do it again. But a broken heart never !? Here is my friend! The difference between sweet tongue and bitter tongue is like the difference between heaven and hell. You either put a rose on your tongue, or honey, and weave a climate that scares heaven for the hearts. If you want, burn others on fire ... BUT I BELIEVE FROM THE HEART AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A ROSE IN YOUR LANGUAGE ... I have not seen the article, I think they deserved it since they angered you so much, you explained what was done very clearly and sincerely. I do not think that he will do it ... I do not know OLIMBERA AND I HAVE NOT RECOMMENDED WHAT WAS BETWEEN YOU ... BUT I KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND I KNOW HOW YOU WRITTEN YOUR THOUGHTS IN EACH. I AM VERY HAPPY, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT LIVE THE EVENT THAT HITTEN HIM SO MUCH. E CANIM. My friend, I am not someone who knows this subject, but I wanted you to know my thoughts ... You have expressed the mistakes made to you sincerely ... As I understand you feel that there is psychological pressure, your willingness to add such an article to the blog shows that some of the people here have already known this subject. People who know your personality and share your feelings have stated that you are right in the comments below .... It is very simple to slander, it is very difficult to get rid of slander ... Woe to the slanderer when divine justice is manifested ... everyone is sane, wise-minded. Who can people doubt their fiancé, spouse, lover, friend by looking at their words, believing in gossip, and giving contradictory answers by word of mouth? If two people do not trust each other, they cannot be together anyway? Olimbera attacking left and right, acting by believing what others say, laid the foundation for ending the relationship? He would not have faced such a situation if he had told his fiancee that he was not guilty rather than behave aggressively to incriminate someone, if he had done his best to fix their relationship. No proof of slander? Even saying that someone else made the slander is a slander? The comment I wrote under the article was able to leave the home page, my witch, know that it is not the first time that such people come across, it will not be at the end ... I say, will we correct everyone's curve. We are content with correcting what we have come across, my Ayaz, your comments ... the comments I made ... there were no comments made by my wife, my pissmicrob ... I did not see what I did ... Olimbera ... after this article, you will never be on my page. I do not want to see .. my page is only visited by men like men .. not like you ..> Well, if I do not fully understand the subject, if a relationship will be destroyed by such things, if trust will be broken with these things, woe to the state of that relationship ... I know my witch for a long time. Who are the people who will appear next to him and talk after him. Just as he is shredded, here we are also crushed against him. my name, as far as I follow; You are an outspoken person of solid character ... I cannot comment on anyone without knowing it fully. but I'm sorry for you. The misunderstanding has gone a long way with the fate I read ... I wish we could solve everything without breaking and tiring each other ... I cannot pass without saying that such simple relationships can end with an interpretation .. ???

dragoth_06 My friend's unrelenting comment ..... Husband and wife, when the betrothed enters, if they put their heart on it, if they can't take care of him and stick to it, this is what it will happen ... :)) Very funny events..If you can't take care of your spouse, let it be in vain :) If there is such a problem in the blog, what is going on in rreel life :) I wondered who are these fiancés, their angut :)
 
If OLimBeRa53 had not deleted the articles, you would understand what I wanted to mean, unfortunately, you are trying to show yourself like this by deleting the things you want. If I say a word to anyone's personality, the events are written like that. It is impossible not to be surprised .. everyone knows who the mine witch is, why he felt the need for this explanation. It is nothing but showing yourself good and someone else bad. My personal life does not concern anyone. AYAZSULTAN, who brought the issues here, tell him not to me, go and tell him .. I do not accept anything that draws the article .. I do not say that I am, let the folks tell you who you are .. I told them what we hear here .. everybody looks friendly from behind hits. I am guilty when people who say I am very sorry for you here say things that are not happening from behind you and say that ... I have no answer to anyone anymore .. I don't care whoever thinks what they think. I laugh and laugh ..: yes, I know you from some of your writings and comments you made on my pages, but if this dialogue between you is developed as the witch wrote, you are wrong BEBeRa I am dead, you are right and I will not be able to reveal it like the room is right or something.Sandy knows very well who I am OLimBeRa 53 As we write on our mutual and only mutual pages, I NEVER DESCRIBE, I DO NOT WANT TO DO IT WITHOUT RESPECT .... PARDON OR, WAS YOU BLIND, WOULD YOU WANT IT YESTERDAY THAT WAS NOT YOU? AND SUCCESSFUL .... BUT YOU KNOW THAT I AND ALL THE FRIENDS YOU SEE WE KNOW WHAT THE WIFE IS IN YOURS ... What will you say to the friends who comment ... are they a lie .. you are the only one right .. You think I have not read what they wrote. witch you took them off. you make out of the ordinary words to create a post on the blog .. sandy knows very well who I am. If my moment will greet you, you are the room. You are making unseemly words. My father has it in Olimbera ... maybe he created it himself ... who knows .. But they said that slander will happen to you. They said that it will happen to you. Sooner or later Allah will ask you what they did. Ahahaa, I laughed a lot ... . I think you are not comfortable at all, be sure about this .. if it is not over, why do you open old notebooks and present it to people in the middle .. I do not run after the LOOK, LOOK YOU ARE VERY CURIOUS LONG JUMP AND DISABLED RUN:) I am very comfortable because I sleep very well. i didn't satin is trying to bring itself to the surface ... WHY YOU OR ANYONE DO NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND MY RELATIONSHIP IS NOT ENDED. I SAY THAT IT WAS THAT FOR TIME .. WELL, I SAY YOU ALSO REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU SAY THE NEW ONE .. HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE TO RUN FOR LAFIN. He is human to the extent that he is able to love, share and respect others for free ... I read AYAZSULTAN before deleting your comments and I wrote an answer to you OLIMBERA53..I will not praise the CADI here like my other friends ... You are in a state of mind, as if you want to take revenge, Like a scorpion, like a venomous snake, you pour out your venom whenever you get the chance ... Are you very relieved when you slander CADI in the article of SAYAZIN? Are you able to close your eyes comfortably when you put your head on the pillow at night? Do you know what I am going to tell you, make this word in your ear: SHAME IS BEAUTIFUL BUT WOMEN'S MORE BEAUTIFUL ... HZ.MUHAMMED ... Please quietly stand up, put a rose on your tongue and the situation would not have come to AYAZIN. You continue to hurt people with your thorns .... You said there are those who talk behind the WIT, and you are one of them. If he has a heart, he will say ""you are like this"" to my FRIEND. I was so surprised as someone who was against such articles without listening to the subject and making a heady comment, but I think it is a childish reason like I left my fiancee because of the WRII at one end of the event and as it was written. Sorry to be blamed for it sounds like humor, but if your relationship is up to an interpretation, woe to you (it is not for me, but the state of your relationship) also as someone who knows witch, I will never do such a thing, but as a person as sure as myself, there is something in this business, or somebody lied to you. He said, or bring out something else. It made me crazy when he said ""I did not write, CADII took it off"" without being shy. LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, IT DOES NOT COME FROM THE PERSON WHO SAYS I DID NOT TAKE OUT ... HIS OWN PERSONALITY HAS BEEN REVEALED ... NOW YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO SPEAK THAT HERE ... AYIP AYIPPPPPPPPPPP, VERY SHORTA ... I DID NOT SAY THAT MY WIFE IS NOT A HUMAN TO DO THIS FOR SOMEONE I DO NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. Dear Witch, first of all, I am sorry when I read this article ... the worst thing in life is to say a word about the honor of a person and to slander .... what is the subject. I do not know him exactly, but as far as I have read and understood from his experiences, the misunderstanding between two people is a problem caused by insecurity .... Friends here, you can not know who is single, married, engaged or science friend, after all, the population officer is not made in identity contour .... it is understood only if that person states this too. let's pass ... we all write comments on what has been shared here. we go to the page and talk about every comment and if we look for ulterior motives and attack that person's personality, we make a mistake here .... There are a lot of things that need to be expressed but they are out of the subject ......... I just read the following and this is how much fesa I feel upset by saying that we have become people who think bad intentions ..... FRIENDS NO ONE KNOW WHAT IS THE PERSONALITY WHICH IS ABOUT THE NAMUS HAYING AND OTHER VALUES OF THAT HUMAN LAF. I REPEAT THIS ARTICLE AND I WAS HITTEN THAT YOU WERE HITTED IN SUCH A CASE. Olimbera means love in Laz language, but this citizen has shown that unlike the nickname he uses, he has a character that is far from them. This friend is not someone who is constantly on the blog and I wondered who are the ones who make judgments behind you without knowing you outside the virtual world. You would understand what I meant, unfortunately, you are trying to show yourself like this by deleting the things you want. If I say a word to anyone's personality, the events are written like that. It is impossible not to be surprised .. everyone knows who the mine witch is, why he felt the need for this explanation. It is nothing but showing yourself good and someone else bad. My personal life does not concern anyone. AYAZSULTAN, who brought the issues here, tell him not to me, go and tell him .. I do not accept anything that draws the article ..

I am guilty when people who say I am very sorry for you here say things that are not happening from behind you and say that ... I have no answer to anyone anymore .. I don't care whoever thinks what they think. I laugh and pass .. :)))))))))) I was very surprised and very sorry for you.Please do not be in an unfair position when you are right. Do not be angry and do not say something wrong. The words said express that person. We congratulate you ... Delete my articles and put your own articles page by page ..... I said something for you yesterday, but I said a little, even they have a respect, but unfortunately you do not ... It means it can happen to everyone but as I said, you made it yourself .. .. FIRSTLY, WE ARE HERE TO SHARE SOMETHING BY OBSERVING FRIENDSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP. , YOU ARE A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND FOR ME WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE TALKING, HOW YOU WILL BEHAVIOR, BEHIND YOUR BEHAVIOR. I read the article in astonishment. I do not understand why this is happening. We share the sadness and happiness here. There is no need for bad words and insults. I say do not hurt yourself at all.

'' and you deleted it too. If there are personalities who cannot handle the comments made here because of all the relatives of his wife's relatives, let him leave immediately and nobody should make comments from the waist down to his honor. everyone knows very well who is what.

The people around suffer the severe pains of pre-life.
The days slip away from the rusty colors of the previous life, carved into the ground.
Falling snow, falling rain, sooty winds pass as color washers. Everything regains its noble color, wears its desolation.
The earth is black to brown, the trees to a cracked gray ??

Without you, I'm just a toy in the hands of time. A prisoner in a triangle; a punching punching bag squeezed by yesterday, today and tomorrow.
Yesterday, while the pain that never went away was pouring in front of me; He tells me tomorrow behind his webbed face that he has unmistakable fears for me.
During the day I become the angel of Walter Benjamins; while my body looks at yesterday in pain, my face turns tomorrow in fear.

When you come?? Time is running out when you come; yesterday, today and tomorrow is melting.
When you arrive, time is being torn, I am falling from the torn place to timelessness. Everything that gains its meaning with time is lost; anxiety, fear, doubt ??
When you come, you stay with me, one of your eyes ?? Your eyes are calling when you come
I do not suck me, the blackness of the eyes.
In timelessness; I hold on to you yesterday and today, and in the absence of tomorrow.
Your gaze keeps me in the middle of the empty space.

I stop to forget from head to toe when you come.
When you come, it's time to pour your weight on me and shed your pain from my head
forget it completely, i am you, happiness from head to toe ??
As you come, an almond tree grows inside me, from white to pink, pink to purple. Home to lovers whose shadow is wrapped in lost green tulips around their necks ??
When you come, I am singing songs that the birds keep quiet.

When you come, my heart is full of mischievous children who do not interfere with calculations and books and do not have their names written on their rational-logic accounts.
With your hands in my hand, the look in my eyes and you in my heart,
life turns into a playful playground for us.

I live the bride like a dream, a fairy tale. Like a dream untouched by the truth ?? And finally come, it becomes a dream ended at the touch of a hand. A fairy tale that ends with sleep ?? Then, a lightning flashes in the midst of calm. While the black veil that covers the truth is opened, the truth becomes a giant who shifts his body and stretches his claw. The dream is torn somewhere, the dream ends, the end of the fairy tale comes to an end.

You go?? You will be a slipped star in my chest, leaving dark darkness behind. When you go, time is resurrected. ??Today?? dress the most sullen face; Yesterday's sorrows and tomorrow's possible fears fall on me again. I keep a reproach on my body, I vibrate. Cannot be added to today, I would not be able to hold back the truth. I stay in the middle like that angel with his body facing backwards and his face facing forward. My throat burns the nostrils of the boy with his toy. My steps fall into the steppes of desolation; Sand escapes my nose, and my heart becomes nervous.

It takes a long time to return to the habit I have acquired without you. Today, the truth, as it touches me; your face is covered, your eyes are closed, your hands disappear. Your words become old songs in the end; that burdened me with moments ??

When you're gone, and a whole time, come to me that is history Once on, the season becomes winter again. There is no festive playground, no almond tree, or a lover carrying a lost green tulip on his neck. When you go, death comes to me, attached to the side of time ?? I'll be an old sudden.",59.txt

While some of my friends celebrate my birthday, I especially thank my grandmother, my late grandfather, mother, aunt, father, uncles and aunts for helping me become a huge man, even a camel, for not excluding me and embracing me. Kissing them all big big ??

Cansu first celebrated my birthday this year; Because he remembered the baffled 9th of April, I cried and brushed my birthday a little too, and then I told the truth, and he congratulated it in advance. :)

Then he congratulated Gorgon ie Hope on r10.net. I guess he saw it on Facebook in his bewilderment but didn't notice the part that says Saturday next to my birthday. With his hastyness, my birthday was celebrated by r10 members on this subject on r10.net. I squirt my thanks to the whole r10 family.

Today I was having a troubled day at school. Because of the incident yesterday, I was waiting for the parents of our student and in our first lesson in the afternoon, Reşit Hoca came to my class and the parents came to my class, they are waiting for you. I went to the teachers' room with excitement and Özlem and Fatma celebrated my birthday in a surprising way. :) I was expecting such a thing from them today though; But the development of the event was good and I was surprised and delighted enough. : D I thank them too ?? :) I also hug my Shrek toy they bought ?? :)

Although April 18 is just new, my birthday was celebrated 2-3 times and it was enough for me. :) Actually, the best quote about his birthday was Mazlum, a 3rd grader on the way out today ?? Birthday is a sin! ?? and it ended the incident for us. :D

Although I do not perceive it as a sin, the people who should actually celebrate on the birthday are mothers and grandmothers ?? i think it should be ??

Anyway, the joke is 25 full, we started counting 26, the crack is gone, I'm taking firm steps towards baldness and navel ?? :)

I hope we see it in 125: D

Edit: The first super surprise of the day came from Nesli dude, she made a video, I liked it very much for my birthday, it made me very happy, it made me very touched. At first I said let me add it to my blog later I said it would be very cocky; But when I said add generation, nothing will happen, I wanted to add it. Thank you very much kankoş: D

Either I uploaded the video to the video sharing site to publish it, but it has not been approved yet, I am so sleepy, I will add it here tomorrow. :D

to this quiet and reckless, rough and fragile love,


The day turns softly, the group is a murder device ..

 

hearse cars pass at night, their names are doomsday ..

 

separation is an orphan in this orphanage

Through the window the slaughterhouse is visible and the love shattered

I watched the trailer before the movie was released and I said I was going. I went and watched, albeit a little late.

The film is about the extinction of the world. For more, either go to the cinema, this is my advice, or download and watch the movie. The visual effects of the movie are really high quality. A very good movie has been made. You should definitely watch and be impressed by those scenes.

You will feel the subway accident and plane crash that you watched in the trailer, watch it, so you will agree with me. You may have gotten bad comments about the ending of the movie around you, but don't ignore it and ignore it. The ending of the movie was a bit wrong for our people, but they did something different, if we think positively, there may even be different opinions about the writer and the director. (:",7.txt
103,"A movie came in recently and settled into the conversation as if it was good. There was a lot of need, to be honest. I'm talking about Vicky Cristina Barcelona :) Although I had the chance to watch it in October, I did not go, it was a shame .. :)

A 2008 Woody Allen story Barcelona. In summary the story is as follows; Americans Vicky (Scarlett Johansson) and Cristina (Rebecca Hall) decide to spend their summer holidays in Spain. The Spanish painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) they meet and his ex-wife, the beautiful but unstable Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz), are in love with these two women. While Vicky is a free-spirited woman open to adventure and sexual adventures, Cristina is a rather conservative and control-loving woman.For these two opposing women, it's all about spending a weekend with Juan Antonio and then into Maria Elena's lives. it turns into an interesting love rectangle.

It is highly probable that the love and art that make the film so interesting are intertwined in every scene. And of course, with the city that makes the film indispensable, the story is watched with more joy. Even though similar views emerge after the ""Match Point"", the movie really does provoke the idea that Allen could have provocative and belong only to him. We can see his being a marginal director from his experimental ideas on sexuality in the film: )
Having said so much about Allen, it would be nice to say something about Johansson and the two great Spaniards. I don't know for some reason, but I got the impression that Scarlet Johansson is playing a role very close to her character in the film. For Javier Bardem, it would be enough to just say “awesome.” According to what Woody Allen learned from his post-shooting editor; It turns out that the two actors improvised in some of the scenes where they spoke Spanish. They did well. Their performances are really enjoyable when you watch them with the awareness that they are two lovers in real life. It would not be wrong to say that Penelope leaves its mark on the second half of the movie.
{Not to mention the friends who evaluated all the actresses before the movie and said ""Scarlett is a number"" and said ""penelope, wow ..."" after the movie :)}
Lastly, Rebecca Hall, who is mentioned in the title of the movie and is not on the poster, also gave a very nice performance. Even the emphasis of the film is completely evident on Cristina. :)
Long story short, ""Vicky, Cristina .."" is a classic for Allen, {indeed, he also grabbed the Golden Globe.}, an enjoyable one and a half hour tour of Spain for the audience, and love is an example of the relationships that provoke in art.
strongly recommended! :)",70.txt

life is going very well!
darling bought me mp3 player!
actually he would take it much earlier, when the military incident became clear, I was dodging, but I prevented it by saying that I would get a phone call anyway, I would pull it a little more. But today we made a decision, looking forward ... so we decided that I needed an mp3 player ...
samsungun machine ... i'm making a test swarm right now… i am writing by listening to music from mp3 player! Excellent, I like the menu, the sound quality, the usefulness, the fatigue ... I can't get it!
Moreover, it was closed very cheaply compared to the market ... I am very glad!
In addition, there are three big slices of kadayif in front of me ... my darling did it for me, hid it from everyone, protected it ... I ate almost all of them, I eat! Do it again, let it do it again, I eat it again ... I have always believed in the dishes that the lady makes with the taste of her hand ... she proved to me this hand flavor thing ...
then ... we were just wandering around in the future ... he saw someone, such as a zippered, trouser top ... I could not name them, what would they say to these models? He liked it, wanted me to try it, I wore it ... how it looked, how I liked it! I say off ... we got it ...
She bought herself a short sleeved knit item, purple ... it was very beautiful, the lady ... I couldn't take my eyes from her ... And she bought a very nice jacket that can be worn in spring, velvet ... I love it!
We haven't been out for a long time ... the house is not a house, we are the room, not as you know ... we have a room and it is beautiful enough to revive all our vital activities. Human way does not come, it connects to a pause ...
I am very happy ... I just chose the songs one by one. I discarded it all, adjusted it, now I'm listening to music! For example, I will go to the island tomorrow. I'll drive for two hours in the morning ... normally, I would look right and left and pray that time passes quickly, now listen to my music ... oh ya ... oh ...
Would you like a kadayif? I would like to say, but I can't really share about the food my girlfriend makes. For example, a bakery makes pasta, my beautiful ... you cannot eat anything else, after you taste it, that degree ...
oh oh are you! my beloved's food, my beloved's pleasures, my beloved's delicaciesiiii! life is good!
Yesterday, he was bored a little ... I will find someone else, there was no excitement about this relationship, he said to my face ... and I told him that it would take at least two years for a new person to get to know him as I do, what he could live with, and whether he could meet the right man one by one. .. he found me very right ... what is the need now, get to know yourself again, oh, you get the breaking points in your eyes, you get a ton of bruises because you don't know yet, you spend time to get to know another person - my darling has no time for such things. , since I was involved in the system :) - I said it's hard work, woman, come on, give up this question ... look, you have a man with serious intentions at your disposal, he knows you, you know ... evaluate it! Well ... I thought today, I gave up on finding someone else ... I swore well :))
Today we made a decision by the way ... I prefer to keep what it is as a surprise but because of the possibility of my beloved or my withdrawal, I am writing here for face-shooting procedures. Those who return from rice stay hungry yaw! :)
Here, dear reader ... I guess I have not lived the happiness I have had in the last two weeks, in the total of my life ... I am going through well, I am over-spirited, I feel very very well ... I am healthy, happy, peaceful, TOK :), even if I exaggerate I can find it handsome. .. :)
Let's take a look at the other topics ...
On Sunday, all the employees of the shop were in assembly ... our shop was flooded on Sunday and night due to heavy rain and we got news on Monday morning ... there were some jobs prepared for assembly, waiting for the day ... Monday) at eight o'clock in the morning, I cleaned four shops, cut the pieces that had been soaked, there was no moving object left in the shop ... according to my personal observations, there is a damage of up to a thousand lira ... It is very good these days, may Allah not break it ... They have closed a debt of fifteen to seventeen thousand lira in the last four months. Eight thousand lira of it was rent, they haven't been able to pay a rent for a year ... I didn't know about them, my father didn't share with us when he didn't go into it, he didn't reflect it ... I was very grateful to us ...
next week today, I will have a serious meeting with my old company ... It is only a matter of time before I get to work for the new year ... I believe I will find a job in less than a week. If I find vacancies, I have a few companies in my mind, places where I know people work or think they definitely need staff suitable for my qualifications, I will distribute my resume and try to arrange a meeting with someone from the human resources ... but it is not clear to look at the old company ... I have no loss ...
When the military service was uncertain, I never despaired of my future, I know myself, if I squeeze the stone, I will get it and drink its water. But now when I look back, I tell myself what I have done and to those around me ... why I was so cruel to myself, why I did it so hard ... look, I say, how everything fits ...
May Allah keep it from the evil eye, this spirit is riveted with a truly smooth, boneless, unperforated happiness in these periods ... It seems to be a long process, I cannot feel as if it will disappear in a moment, even if I force it ...
ohy .. anyway ... how sweet it is to be so close to the source of my happiness, to be able to touch it, to stay with you, to feel your breath in your body, how it is unreachable for others and the truth of my life and how perfect it is for me! orphans are stuttering sentences, let me cut them here ...
I will be able to listen to music outside now! long live!
life is Beautiful! feeling the belonging of a beautiful woman, much more beautiful ... perfect ...",73.txt

108,"Our new transfer Burak Yilmaz said that he is happy and proud to be playing in our team. Burak made explanations about his transfer in the live broadcast he attended on FB TV after the signing ceremony. Noting that it is a very nice feeling to be asked by a big club like our Fenerbahçe, Burak said, ""It is a nice thing to be asked, but it is a very different feeling to be asked by Fenerbahçe. The waiting period was a bit difficult. But now I am happy to be happy"".

Stating that our Fenerbahçe has achieved very successful results in recent years, Burak said, ""After the victories and successes achieved by Fenerbahçe, everyone has a contribution to these successes and to come here. When asked by Fenerbahçe, it is a very different feeling. It is difficult to tell, it is necessary to live"". said.

Burak stated that our Fenerbahçe is a very big community and that many things will change in his life as a footballer of this team and said, ""As a more changed Burak, I am ready for everything"". Emphasizing that his family was happy with this transfer, Burak said, ""They were also impatient and excited like me. At the moment, they are at least as happy as I am.""

When our team was reminded of the future of a new coach and asked whether it was an advantage for him, Burak said, ""The arrival of a new teacher seems to be an advantage for me, but this applies to everyone. The incoming teacher does not know any of us."" Stating that our Fenerbahçe has very high quality players, Burak said, ""Playing with them will also affect my performance. All of them are high quality players. Playing with very talented players will both improve me and increase my performance.""

Stating that Fenerbahçe Sükrü Saracoglu Stadium is a stadium where football players are very impressed as its ambiance, Burak said, ""An atmosphere that the footballer hesitated while going on the field. Fenerbahçe fans always fill the stadium and always support the football player. I will do as much as possible. I think I will not embarrass anyone. I am very happy and proud, ""he concluded.

112,"Fernando Alonso said he was very happy to be fourth in the Italian Grand Prix. Expecting a tough race in Monza, the former world champion switched to normal rain tires by taking a risk when the track just started to dry after the second part of the competition.

Alonso's decision came to fruition, and after the Renault pilot returned to the track, he was able to gain position, finishing in fourth place, the half he started in eighth.

With the Spanish driver leaving Monza today with 5 points, Renault equalized the points with Toyota in the brands classification with four races before the end of the season.

""I am very happy. Today's result is very good because Monza was a race we would expect to see such a result,"" Alonso said.

""We got the 5 points we needed in the competition in the championship. This was really an important reward and a good source of motivation for the rest of the season,"" said Alonso.

""I wonder what awaits us in Singapore now,"" said the double world champion pilot.

Teammate Nelson Piquet, on the other hand, finished 10th in the halftime he started from behind. ""I had a good fight in the back group today. My speed was good considering my fuel load. I think it was a satisfactory result,"" Piquet said.

The Brazilian pilot said, ""Unfortunately I did not get any points. I think the ranking results are decisive in this. So I want to keep my optimism. Now I will concentrate on the preparations of the race in Singapore.""",79.txt

I definitely do not know you. You said give me a tip. I already gave it. I guess you found it too, you mentioned the pessimist blogger here, that's me. ""Maybe I like it, lovers huh?"" ""I looked for a dew grain on the wings of the parting ship going in the clouds of sadness, I look for the tears of love ??? Why did I do it? Though there are a total of 18 posts. 50 drafts. a single page. The duration of the entry on the site is under 1 minute. eheheh. I did it with the first version of the blogger. I was losing after that.I said, will it be a good host from google.It stops there even when I die.I'm a pessimist.I'm depressed. , makes you wonder.

Turn on TV, love movie. Turn on the radio, I could not get enough, I love you. they wrote novels. love murders in newspapers. suicides. That's half of people's daily pastimes. I said what the hell, I went and fell in love with girls. willingly. they fed me. I wrote and stopped. I looked people are getting depressed. I enter it too, I wrote it. I said woah. I said, what the hell am I here? I said okay, I'm writing my mood from the most pathetic. I am writing what feeds me. I put my head up. just like yours. obliquely. They said what this man, I said I put my head on. I said, look where he's looking at my head below. Do you know what I tried to take that pose? bald head became your adjective. This is one of my adjectives. If you knew how many adjectives I have, alchemy. I said it suits me. I looked and did not understand the goods. I said, I made people hit the number 3 so that people could see the inside of my head better, then I put it on the blog (this is the word of the mustafa topalogl. I then wrote a statement next to him. They said, well, are you a girl, you are on the internet to yourself. I said we are bridesmaids. They said it is even more grave that I cannot write here. Did you understand that? I'm angry. They say footer under the sites, it belongs to it, does not copy or copy or writes a filer. I also wrote, ""It is my will, my wisdom, it is mine."" my man, my man, to you. I did not write the last two of course: D I write what I want, I said to myself. I even took notes. it is pretentious and depressive, I will add. I told the lonely spouse friend like a fool, I wrote a blog, enter, see. Where did I tell you? google has indexed it nicely. dmoz.org island I sent it to catalog me. Thanks to the editor hired a bidet under the art, look and poetry placed me under it. I almost cried. not that. ""How is this poetry?"" said one of the strong readers. Spelling error full. no commas. disgusting. I said it could be whatever it is. poem, text is here, message.tutt. I aligned it to the right, as in arabic. It's not poetry, whatever it is, whatever. I said mubarek, inside of me, like a compiler. You know when writing a program. You write a program, you make a spelling mistake. you forget the point, the compiler throws the error to turn off the parenthesis, he says an ox in the face, you made a mistake. I have always cared for it, like a spelling guide in its sections. Even compilers are not that ruthless. He tries to understand what he wrote. machine but, I believe you know it has a soul in its punch. at least there are development environments called IDEs. It warns you did you write wrong. Look, I'm making a mistake here. You can write that or something. In a time under a blessed minute, you did not understand what I wrote. Don't you take your girlfriend and go to a love movie. I know you wrote the comment of the movie on your blog. now this guy went to this movie alone. Does it sink to you when I write? and this is my blog adventure. I struggled with these. I reacted. I tried to write it as much as possible. I can't write anymore. one summer a thousand oh hear. it stays in a draft when I write.

As for you alchemy. I poked you, am I beautiful on the message. It was a very stupid sentence, but I wrote it to be interesting. I actually poked the followers here.

I like your message. head picture at the top. the meaning you attribute to footera. because I tried to do the same. I tried to explain that the blog is a show off business. This is what you do, this is what I do. in those here. Some of them tell about their cat, they love their cat very much, they put their pictures. some of them tell about technology, actually they show their knowledge. He tells the food, look how much I am doing. but in essence it is personal.

I said SHOW to blogging, but I said it in different meanings. It could be showing off, it might be telling about your cat ... it actually fits in every sense. It has more than one meaning. In any case, I ask what harm does it do to you? Isn't that what we've already done? the essence of the blog?

Blogger, facebook, twitter, jaiku, sosyomat etc. show. Facebook, for example, people put their own pictures there, some of their cats (this cat thing is so confused everywhere), some of their car, motor, shop. These days, holiday pictures are in fashion. Those who put their pictures with their beloved to get this cover for you. Now I haven't done a tenth of it on my blog. I know if I do even more, since it's kind of a more personal thing. but come and see those who put these pictures. Even a picture of my head is enough to drive you crazy. Those who said that you got your water out, ironed my head the next day because the girl left me (uhuh uhu). How is it? I do not understand. what makes this nation mad. My hand and face are smooth, my eyes are blue, my height is he? don't feed my complex? You put a picture of the cat (again, the cat is everywhere) on your blog. to facebook. twittera what is that Let girls say, you are very handsome too. you are super romantic. let them fall in love with the picture of my head eheheh. let them feed me, what's wrong.

In fact, this is a cry to the blogging realm. alchemy, definitely not to you. You win the beauty contest. I did not feed your curiosity. I write in acrostic. If you say handoff, accept the room. I said, you asked, I said.
I'm confused, the room is right. this was the occasion actually. all bloggers get confused. but I think it's a little clearer now.

I do not know how you understand in any of my last writings, but (the important thing is not what you understand and what I write) siminya is not a criticism for you. on the contrary, there is discretion.

it's been too long. Is it complicated? What is it again? :D",80.txt

the cats began to drive me crazy more and more. The night is now in my dream, these cats. I said cat instead of himself. grrr. meow.

I'm fixing here. though it happens as before.

I said SHOW to blogging, but I said it in different meanings. It can be showing off, it can be telling about yourself (not the cat)… it fits in every sense. It has more than one meaning. In any case, I ask what harm does it do to you? Isn't that what we've already done? the essence of the blog?

@mixx ... when my head is mixed, so beautiful :))

@ interesting anonymous ... what is this gilgamesh epic you wrote? etc.
I think I understood what you wanted to tell, the popular culture, the competition in the blog world, the race, the imposition of me, I'm great, everyone is curious about me, you are jealous of me and criticize their mood.
There are points where you are right, but it should not be exaggerated; We have lived, we grow and we will die, we have to give way to those who simply want to live life, which is such a simple summary, everyone needs to breathe and must decide for himself how to take his breath.

20 August 2008 Wednesday 16:43 Untitled said ...
ah siminya ah i wrote an epic but i wrote in vain. You were taken over again. am i beautiful It is a very human curiosity. a sense of affirmation. I said, too, you are beautiful. I confirm you all the time.

I wouldn't say, a person is making you have his cat (meow) confirmed. everyone says oh how beautiful it is, very cute. confirms his knowledge. Everybody says wow, what a knowledgeable guy. confirms its culture.
they call the man like a library. Of course, this happens in a subtle way. I am writing, you are writing on a technical subject. Someone gets up and comments. It's super yaw. the other one is coming, it is really good or something. now why is this guy writing this? Did he take a mission to inform the nation? lie. it shows itself in a different way. It is a very human and normal situation. there is no abnormal situation in this. you gave an example. You made a warez site. They say you are great teacher. Where do you find them? blah blah blah. It's praise, confirmation, approval or whatever. It happens in real life, it happens on the blog in different ways. But on the other hand, these people who see them as perfectly normal and praiseworthy things do not affirm a girl's beauty. like you. I looked at the comments and someone did not say that this girl is beautiful. as I understand it in real life. Isn't it alchemy? Don't you talk about this in that article? You said too, or am I ugly? They hesitated you.
here is a crucial point.

I understood it. or I took it out of that post. I exaggerated, I wrote an epic.

@akturk said in the comments that we will only look. I think he understands from the beautiful. Though he said that he is beautiful, he even confirms that I understand: D I wrote on it because you are beautiful anyway. I also confirm if necessary. I also affirm a human feeling. I say that alchemy why others do not confirm.

Is it that difficult to write two lines. It means you are beautiful alchemy.
how can I write more clearly. alchemy imposing your beauty affirmative the one who imposes your feelings and the one who approves it. It was a little harsh though. what am i You go and understand the opposite alchemy. I call you this is a blog, I say do it, I'm writing an epic, it doesn't work, I don't exaggerate.
how can I write more clearly. I say I'm sick of cats, culture, knowledge. I say write yourself. I say write yourself. Let them say show off. write down your cat (meow) if you have one. (I hope not, I knocked the cats from the ground. figuratively so: D) Write what you want. You are not going to ask anyone what to write anyway. but don't hit the ground when someone grabs himself and writes. By the way, do not hit the ground for cats (meow).

""cat, I liked these two words very much on their own.""
Let this be my new slogan. there is only one letter difference between them. attention please.

By the way, I wrote anonymously because I don't like google. It constantly indexes me everywhere. I'm getting angry. Alchemy scares people. you also indexed. I know you from there. Otherwise, I'm not someone around you. I don't know those here either. I'm traveling to death because there are blogs who write something interesting. get comfortable. I'm neither a pervert nor a hacker. I'm not at the grocery store @ukturk: ​​D but god, my grocery store is a good man. By the way, love to grocery stores. google indexes. grocery writers, I do not mess with them, I say to them. Google indexing me axle !. he associated me with something. google divine. I do not suspect if someone who is annoyed with me is doing something.

Alchemy was a beautiful article. There hasn't been an article that made me think about it for a long time. It has been quite a brain grimace for me. I hope so for you and those here. It is true that I exaggerated quite a bit. I offer my love and respect. to you and the others here. I finish softly and avoid Google indexing me.",81.txt

I thought you were telling something in the first anonymous post, but in this post I saw that you just lined up the words. Who wants to let him talk about science, who wants his cat, who wants beauty. Some to brag, writer, others to beat, others to relax. you hit everybody on the stone, but why did you make this comment? You went to a stature, albeit anonymously. okay, you are smart, you understand beauty, you are attractive, you are handsome, you are good writing. Most importantly, you are different. You see things that we cannot see. you are awesome, nameless.
Also, from where and how do you expect those who are here to reach an opinion that alchemy is beautiful or ugly? My opinion is that those who are unsure of something need approval. I don't even think that alchemy needs to be validated for its beauty.

I would like to ... well, he gave me my anonymous offensive tongue with pleasure, I think that such long writers are wasted, for some reason, writing is a very long article, especially if it is a long article, it is a very complicated task to tie its head to the end, to form a main idea, to explain its problem clearly, I appreciate our anonymous cat lover

@ Untitled..Now you don't understand me again, you will say siminya, I confess I have difficulty.
As Antonun said, I did not expect to call me beautiful in that article, I would ask this question a lot, I would look for reasons to participate in beauty contests, I would trust the beauty of my lips and think that I would win the contest, etc., I tried to explain how empty I was thinking and I was naive.
Except for a few people here, why would people say ""you are beautiful"" to someone they haven't seen? wouldn't that be a lie
The reason why I write a blog is not to be appreciated, for example, I have been threatened to be taken to court in my article about our punto, I have the expectation of getting a reaction, I want to get reaction from time to time rather than being appreciated and saying ""you are great"".

I do not understand that you are so angry with Google's indexing, it sounds fun to me, think horse, you are calling ""horse"" people are coming, you are saying ""weed"", it is very funny :))",82.txt

120,"I'm Confused No matter which portal you are saying, which forum will I set up?
Monday, 13 Apr 2009
go to comments add comment
I am a beginner, but I can summarize my own opinion as follows, at least when I was setting up my forum, I did this, I installed and tried all of the ipb-mybb-aef-vb-smf-phpkf -phpbb systems because there was no member anyway and it was not recognized yet, but it was also damaging. Later, I read these discussions on many forum sites and tried to get ideas, then I thought of evaluating the forums based on various factors, I considered factors such as seo event-indexing-pr and examined the main site of all the main locations and tried to set up the site through it now I want to share it here. Of course, you can consider what I have written as an empty work, but I set up my forums based on this, that most forum founders attach importance to a good SEO and a lot of indexing. respectively1-VBULLETIN This system is currently being used as the most advanced forum system in Turkey. the system is $ 180 and the seo water fee is $ 120, the main site is not seo installed. The pr of the main site is seen as 6 and the forum is seen as 6 and the indexing rate of the forum is 286K (it should be remembered that this is a paid system and this is a paid system with its resources, of course, it should be able to outperform the free ones, otherwise the money given has no meaning) also the system is null As it can be found very easily on the internet, it is not recommended to use it is definitely not recommended. First of all, the right of use should be observed (etc. It is said that there will be a revolution in the 4th version)

2-IPB, our other paid forum system, Invision Power Board, this system is not very popular due to the scarcity and inadequacy of support pages in Turkey and I think it is a better forum system than vbullet. Of course, it is paid and everything has a developed structure, let's not extend the site's PR 7 When it comes to the forum, PR 7 indexing event, 156K (Turkish admin panel cannot be found or distributed in Turkey and this can cause it not to be kept in Turkey, but it does not exist in known good sites, it is also very famous in the world. available on sites) (ipb 3rd version will be more advanced and error-free)

3-phpbb is free, this system is quite old and a known system is free, it has caused a lot of spread in Turkey, I think the 3 version looks better after the 2 version, but there is a lot of trouble with it, especially for novices like me, I had difficulty in installing the mod, but if you want to learn the job, I say try . (support sites are not as good as before) (noticeable with phpbb2 and phpbb 3.x versions)

4-Mybb is probably our youngest forum system, this site uses seo different from other forum sites, so it should be a little more advantageous. It is a new and evolving system, it has a dynamic structure and it has a very easy structure especially in module loading, I like it like a child's play, but its themes are terrible except a few and it turns out that I made a new theme that makes each edit. Support sites do not touch a hand, but there are live support sites, it is not difficult to get support, but it seems a little inexperienced. The latest version is 1.4, but it is said that it will get rid of all its bugs and be more advanced in the next 1.6 version.

5-PHPKF This is a completely Turkish forum and I think it is a constantly developing forum. I like it and the 1.6 version is on the main site that will be released in February. site PR 3 Forum Pr3 forum indexing rate 3,400

6-AEF has a nice structure, it looks like ipb, but unfortunately it has Turkish support, but if there is Turkish support in the future, I think it will progress. I read that the 1.0.9 version will be released on the main site, which will be released with the new version. Forum Pr 3 index 3,200

7-SMF, let's get to the system that I love so much, I hope it will get its old days with 2 versions. (The reasons may be that it has not been developed or it is now very easy to load vbulletin and people are curious about it and null vbulletin uploads) Pr of the site 8 Forum's 7 and indexing rates 193K

Yes, you may find this research absurd or logical, but I did such a research, of course, I did not depend on it because none of these systems were established at the same time and they do not have the same structure, each has its own beautiful features, of course, there are disadvantages, but there is a nice feature in this. It pushes forum systems and thrives. This will of course half the users who use these scripts.

Note: I do not know how accurate it is to compare paid systems such as ipb-vbulletin with free systems such as smf-mybb, but everything that is paid is not always good. But there is a fact that vbulletin Turkey has a very supportive structure and also because the employees work for a salary, they focus all their attention on this job and this makes it possible to come in more quickly.

But what should it be? Doesn't every person face difficulties in their life? In primary school, middle school, high school, university, then in your professional life ?? Difficulties are always faced by people. Developments that overturn their expectations are coming. So what should we do in such situations?

Should we accept and submit? Do we not be stubborn and rebel?

Since our lives generally take place in big cities, village life, district life, and our lives in East-South East provinces find it difficult for us. Our habits cannot find a response here. Our expectations do not satisfy us; but life goes by ??

Here is where it matters. Our life flows. It passes away when we complain, resent him or laugh at him ??

I think we should measure and reap what we have in such situations. We should understand well what our environment gives us, what it will give and what it cannot give, and we should shape our lives accordingly. Do not forget that we will be disappointed to ask for more than the environment can give us. There will necessarily be bad people, officious people, even dishonorable people around us; but we must stretch our breasts to these as well. I think it would be appropriate to apply the term sherbet according to the pulse in such cases. I'm not saying go and be buddy with them, don't get me wrong. But neither take them in front of you nor put them above your head. Remember, it is not worth it for them, you continue to direct your life ??

Actually, these are really hard, nothing is like what I see from Bursa. Be it political, educational or social. But despite everything, we are here and we have to continue our lives. By raising our standards as much as we can.

I have a suggestion for you, especially to friends who will go to teach in East or South East; In my opinion, do not expect too much from here, reduce your expectations to the minimum (do not completely deflate). While I was marking my 21st choice, I was saying that there is enough water and electricity in my destination. I never even thought about which village would be, what would I go through. But I was a bit lucky and assigned to the district center and I met many times more than my expectations. For some of our friends, even these places are not enough, they despise these places. So this comes to the point I call expectations, past life and insatiability ??

I know that there are thousands of village teachers who want to be in my place. And that's why I don't complain on grams, I know I can't afford to complain Because I'm trying to measure the environment I live in and make it self-sufficient, so it goes in terms of life ??

Share from the story; Observe your environments thoroughly, draw your boundaries, do not exaggerate your expectations and enjoy life.",87.txt
122,"I said when I won the university and went to a different city ... I know life and I can cope with negativities.
But every day I learned something new and completed the university in a confused state ... if I write it, they say it would be a novel, just like that ...
If I go back to the topic of cafe and business ....

-People are shaped by the environment they live in. Of course, the family is a very important factor, but the environment also includes and shapes the family ....

For example, someone who lives in Kartal ... or garden houses or meat ..... Different people live in different districts of Istanbul ....

And these differences can sometimes reach extreme ....

Thoughts, differences of opinion .. different perspectives on the life we ​​have lived .. education .. braiding .. surfing, as the pieces vary ....

EXAMPLE 1-

I went to stay with my friend ... He was sitting in Şirinevler. People know that there is an overpass once in a while ... you pass and find yourself in Ataköy ....

Anyway, we passed the passage and drank something in Ataköy ... The weather was hot ... It was night and we slept ... But there is no way to sleep ... A strange noise outside ... even voices .... Women are on the balconies of their buildings very close. The seeds in their hands are chatting from the balcony to the balcony at 2 o'clock in the night ... I warned, but who does it ... In my neighborhood, there is no problem after a certain hour ... Especially, there is no conversation from the balcony to the balcony.

EXAMPLE 2-

I shop at the grocery store ... The owner of the grocery store ...- I will not even tell about his dress --- so the person who introduces him like that asks me if I pray !!! .... first looks at the man's face ... then I ask why he asked this question .. He says I cannot pray with the nail polishes on my nails !!! ... And without even bothering to argue with the man, I leave the market and leave what I bought ...

EXAMPLE 3-

I opened the cafe after opening it ... I printed 3000 flyers and placed it among the newspapers ... I made a sign ... I also made a pedestal sign in front of the door ... It has been a year and there are still people who think the cafe is a hairdresser before me ... I put on a big light and it lights up until the morning .... I started thinking that either the people here are illiterate or they are blind ....

 

Of course, people are diverse ...

 

The place where my cafe is located is very easy to reach and it is also popular due to the fact that the consulates will be gathered here soon ...

I opened the cafe right in the middle of suburban and cozy people ....

The suburban section came to the treasure land on time ... The bigot, the conservative and the only work is rumor .... they reject change for some reason .....

The part of the kokos came here by settling in luxury houses built by contractors who had seen the increasing popularity of the district 3-5 years ago.

The same mukhtar serves the people living in the district, but there is a huge wall that is not visible in between and I am right in the middle of it ....

So there is a complete gap ...

Neither suburbs nor cocktails come to my cafe ...

I mostly host people from outside ... Simple, normal and people like me are my godly customers ... But of course I don't have many customers because of not being able to serve the people where I am .... So I am always at a loss ....

Since it is a cafe, hot drinks such as coffee, tea and cold drinks ... pies, cakes and cakes sometimes ...

 

Women from the suburbs are afraid of their husbands ... husbands are afraid of their wives !!! What if someone hears it ... There is no such thing as a cafe culture ...

Those who are members of the Kokoş district prefer Akmerkez, Kanyon and other shopping centers ... Those who come by saying ""Ayy here is such a cafe"" and show the words of amazement and surprise ... And they never come again in order not to lose their prestige ....

 

I felt the need to write this article because H @ ndecik gave a very nice comment to my article titled ""I'm confused"" ..... and made suggestions ....

Believe me, h @ ndecim, I worked on people here .... But they could not accept my formation here ... 7 days after the opening, they told the police that illegal women were working in x cafes and they broke me - just because I was born in Germany ... think about the rest no longer---

Whatever the rumors were, it was completing the day with a loss and feeling like I had done nothing ....

I was tired of standing out among different people ...

It was tiring me to pay 3-5 billion rents in different districts.

As I said, I was confused but the main people were tiring me ....

In short, I am confused and tired ....

 

I hope my decision making process passes quickly and painlessly .....

123,"It must have been a thousand years since I wrote. Of course, a thousand things passed through me while I was not writing. I went to many places and met many new people. But I don't even care about any of them. Just one person just haunts me. He's on one end of the world and I'm on the other, but it's like he's always with me. I take him with me everywhere I go. I have never experienced such a strange feeling in my life. The bad thing is that this feeling doesn't go away. It hasn't been passing for months ... I don't know where this job will end. I guess I shouldn't go back to writing without getting my head together :)",89.txt
124,"Yes, how nice is it, to say that to apply. I don't want to overwhelm you with an emotional article before the sensuality of my last article wears off, ""Well, dear audience? The presenter of a festival whose month passed this too (let me not say which one, child should not be disgraced :)) was constantly using this phrase instead of a period at the end of each sentence. And in the blog of my very dear (!) Friend, with the same logic, ""Well, how do you think, dear readers?"" At the end of each blog post. OK what is this now? Well I got scabies. It is difficult for human beings to understand, we definitely want to approve of everything we do. It's as if what we do adds nothing to us without the approval of others. I can hear you say, ""Our social beings are here and there :)"", the moon is my dear audience, my place is you: P


Anyway, we wrapped the deer again, what was I talking about today, I watched a very nice movie today. Something like ""Ensemble, c'est tout"" in French, Turkish in ""We are together, we are happy"". The coming together of people who are unhappy in their small lives to reveal the patter of love in each other. As you can see in the picture above, they are all together and happy. While watching the movie, I was sad with them, I was happy together. I recommend, I do not want to explain the subject and bore it.

Let me write here a few movies that I can enjoy over and over again that make me happy after watching like this:

1- Amelie

Amelie is definitely number one. Which of us wouldn't want to be a little Amelie sometimes? I mean, at least there is such a person, and that is me. All he does is to add color to his boring life and he does it not only by looking at things like everyone else but with a little different and positive eyes. Once on the scene where he is very happy, you have to walk with a visually impaired uncle and tell him what is happening around him:
""Let me help you. Step down. Here we go! The drum major's widow! She's worn his coat since the day he died. The horse's head has lost an ear! That's the florist laughing. He has crinkly eyes. In the bakery window , lollipops. Smell that! They're giving out melon slices! Sugarplum, ice cream! We're passing the park butcher. Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45! Now the cheese shop. Picadors are 12.90. Cabecaus 23.50. A baby's watching a dog that's watching the chickens. Now we're at the kiosk by the metro. I'll leave you here. Bye! ""
Having an eye on a blind person and opening the eyes of a few people who cannot fully see life and the beauties in life as we did, during the film :) This is a very beautiful movie, I came to watch it again.

2- Jeux D'enfants

I don't know how I've never watched this movie before, when it was cheerful. I listened to ""La vie en rose"" playing in the movie so many times that my roommates loved me :) The movie is literally passed with ""Kids Games"" like a French translation. It is a sad and funny story that takes over and ends with a small toy. Also, the actors were so cute and so full of their roles that the moon was so cute. The love stories that passed through the game ended with the game again, okay, but still I wish we could see the rest, I was sorry at the end :(

There are other movies but my dear wanted to write them for now. :)",9.txt

You are telling me not to worry
You think it's my hand not to be sad

Do you know
I loved you again
I thought of you again
I was yours again
Tonight.

I committed one sin today, my rose, another sin today
But a sin worse than every day
I fell in love with you again my dear
Now you're not with me
Who knows what are you doing now
Maybe you think what to cook in the kitchen
Maybe
You are in front of the TV, you smile around you
Do not be sad my dear, I will be sorry instead of you.",93.txt

in the loneliness of the lonely nights

I'm counting the stars

one by one,

each one different beautiful,


the secret stories of the night

telling me ...

I'm calling you...

i live you

with you..

in sad nights

my eyes are wandering

I'm asking you to the stars

did you see

that?

memories come alive in my eyes

reflected in the sad nights

from my memories ..

in my heartbroken night

shining brightly

As the stars rise inside me

I'm listening to the tunes of our song

on that sizzling record ..

every night the moon falls apart

stars falling one by one

I take it and put it on my hair

while waiting for you to come ..


i'm sad

only stars are friends to me

they talk about us

in secret nights

they are also sadly ..

I scream my loneliness

my voice is not reaching from far

you...

i am waiting for you to come

hopefully

by dreaming you,

but

you are far from me

as far as you can ..

i loved you all my life

I will love

your love won't die

always inside me ...",94.txt
130,"Another innocent baby who came to the world with debt to his neck

What would his status be?

When you think about yourself at the end of fifteen years

Not an aristocrat, but a black box slave

In fact, the statuses are very different, the cliffs

There is a status in the middle and it is so clear that I am Purgatory as if

Half of my sins equal half of my good deeds

I'm waiting for my executioner to make my final decision

Maybe he's just the dark-eyed killer to pull my chair

I'm sad, wondering if I was a dancer in my first life?

Without status but happy he's not me, he's stuck in purgatory

I see my enemies on the one hand and him on the other

He looks at me from afar

I wish you could look at your eyeballs and see if you were lying

One day when I look into your eyes with love

Without thinking about what he said what you got in my eyes?

Stay in between, between two walls

Like I'm crushed, maybe John will make himself a new face from my pulp

Too hard to grow up, stay in the middle, not being able to enjoy the top and bottom ??

I will have a land in the future, a thousand square meters

Four hundred square meters to the municipality, for its good

I will invite you to the barbecue party if I can find middle status behind

I don't know if a person can skip status after casting?

Maybe people are born with a status and die

I don't know, I'm a sad adjective. What am I good for?

My friends usually love me but when I tell them they greet me

But I don't know I'm not self-confident and sad

I just don't know, I know but can't show. What am I at this unknown station ??

Tell me! Tell me! What are we? Again I don't know again ??

I get good advice from people who are both lousy and happy and high and proud.

Listening, nodding, nodding, saying living knows

In my fifteenth year, I can't rejoice that I was born

Fake smiles for my mother to be happy

I'm aimless

I think the problem is here.

"My Father, Filmmaker Rob Cohen is a Rapist and Child Molester",133,at5vpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/at5vpp/my_father_filmmaker_rob_cohen_is_a_rapist_and/,16,1550770380.0,"My name is Valkyrie Weather, born Kyle Cohen, the oldest child and trans daughter of film producer/director Rob Cohen (The fast and the Furious, xXx, and The Hurricane Heist among many others). When I was very young, Rob used my body for his own sexual gratification. My mother witnessed one of the assaults when I was between two and two and a half years old, and has since confirmed what she saw. This fact has cost me more than I could ever convey here. Rob has also raped at least one other woman, in her sleep. I know this because he would occasionally tell the story as an anecdote. ¬†Presumably in an effort to turn me into the straight son that he wanted me to be, Rob took me to see sex workers and establishments in Thailand and The Czech Republic starting when I was as young as 13/14 years old. Through therapy and support from loved ones, I no longer feel that I owe this man any loyalty. And thanks to the #metoo movement, I have found the will to speak out. While Rob will in all likelihood escape criminal justice, I demand that my story be heard. I am not seeking financial restitution, nor do I have a career to promote. My greatest hope is that others who have been hurt by Rob Cohen feel that they are able to come forward as well.

For a few weeks to a month when we first met and were active having sex we used condoms. We would be safe as far as I knew and checked since I was not on birth control. 

It wasn‚Äôt until one night when him and I were being intimate that I had noticed him stop for a quick second while I laid on my back asking what was wrong and he replied ‚Äúnothing trying to get harder is all‚Äù.... I naively believed him. We got back to it and when he finished I noticed his condom was off, throw to the side of the bed. I realized he had finished inside of me and took his confirm off halfway through while knowing how serious I was about making sure it was on and secure at all time. I remember being in disbelief and not knowing what to say... ‚Äúdid you... did you take the condom off???‚Äù Realizing he had finished inside me at this point I began to freak out even harder. He subtly said ‚Äúyeah but it‚Äôs okay I just really wanted to feel you‚Äù. 

I was naive. I was a victim. I had consensual sex with a man who at a point turned against my consent and did something harmful, and detrimental and most important non consensual to my body. The second he did this, the second our understanding of using that condom became null is what I consider non consensual... some may say rape. Perhaps I‚Äôm still in denial 2 years later to even think of the idea that someone I was with would have raped me. I didn‚Äôt experience the fear of rape with a stranger and endangerment because no one told me someone you were dating and trusted could rape you. To me rape was always this idea of someone random, a victim, a target by chance... but looking back I understand. I was raped. I was raped in a scenario where I was not even aware it was happening until it was over with. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine the what if‚Äôs of if this had happened before and if i was too naive to look or check or know. 

I trusted you. But you broke my trust and acted like it was nothing. You put my body at risk, you put me in a position where I felt betrayed, used, and terrified of the possibility I would end up pregnant when I thought I was so safe. You‚Äôre reasoning? ‚ÄúIf you end up pregnant I‚Äôll help you take care of it‚Äù... but I didn‚Äôt want a baby. I didn‚Äôt want to be pregnant. I didn‚Äôt consent to you even doing what you did. And yet I still remained with you for a few months after that. Because I didn‚Äôt know at the time that this wasn‚Äôt normal, I thought I was over reacting, that maybe from my abusive past relationships this is what all relationships end up like. But it‚Äôs not and it should never be what you experience most importantly with someone you trust to be intimate with and trust with your consent to your own parameters and limits.

I was raped. It took me 2 years and a long term loving NEW boyfriend who does nothing but treat me in every way possible as a delicate rose. Who asks for my consent and doesn‚Äôt get mad when I‚Äôm not in the mood. Who cherishes my body and assures me he would never do and has never done something against my own will. It took me 2 YEARS and finding my soulmate to finally realize what a health and non abusive relationship was.

Why #MeToo is needed For both women and men- Childhood sexual abuse leads to childhood sexual abuse. Leads to brokenness all around.,32,9lgf4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9lgf4w/why_metoo_is_needed_for_both_women_and_men/,5,1538690767.0,"My father was left alone at six years old with a group of teenage boys by his older brother. While he was with them alone, they sexually violated him. He never received help to recover from this traumatic event and it lead to self-medicating with alcohol by the age of 12. He carried this with him through his whole life and the alcoholism and losing my older brother at birth ruined his marriage to my mother. They divorced. 

It was the agreement that I would spend every other weekend with him. Most of the time he was constantly drunk and did quite a number of things to me. I won‚Äôt go into detail but it was childhood sexual abuse. It started when I was 5 as I can remember and went on until I stopped going to see him at 18 years old. I developed dissociative identity disorder very early into this abuse so I didn‚Äôt remember any of it until I was 22. 

I lived my whole life as the kid who forgets things sometimes, the kid who had voices in her head that she called imaginary friends, the kid who ‚Äúlied‚Äù and did strange things, or who went off for no reason because of the symptoms of my disorder. 

When I finally started to remember it came back in nightmares. I was going through a really abusive relationship and it triggered it all. The memories come and go now. Sometimes they‚Äôre crystal clear and sometimes it‚Äôs just a blurr of horrible emotions and sometimes it seems like they‚Äôre not there at all... but... 

When someone goes through something traumatic at a young age and show signs of it, it‚Äôs our job as fellow human beings. And especially if your a parent and these kids show signs of it, to get them the help they need right away. 

My father was a completely different person when he was sober. He was caring and gentle even though he still showed signs of trauma. When he was drunk it was totally different. The symptoms of the trauma became so much worse and his daughter (me) was the only thing around to dull the pain. He passed a little over two years ago and never received help to heal from his trauma. It twisted him up and turned him into a monster. 

I however truly believe that had his family got him the help he needed at a young age he would have never been twisted up into the ‚Äúman‚Äù he became. It‚Äôs so important to tell our stories even if we don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt get justice. It‚Äôs so important to spread the awareness and advocate for the mental health aspect of abuse.

My family couldn‚Äôt help me, I showed no real signs of being abused. But my father did. Stories his side of the family tells of him as a child shows clear signs of it. They didn‚Äôt know that those are clear signs, but I‚Äôm not fully convinced that if they did know they would have done anything. I have strong reasons to believe that they are horrible awful people because of the way they have treated me. 

But there are very good parents out there who do watch and care about their children. I hope your children are always safe from harm. But it‚Äôs always good to know the signs. The RAINN.org website is a perfect resource to learn all you need to know. 

Stay safe my friends and stay strong. Always speak out, we can‚Äôt let others silence us. ",32,0,meToo,Lady-Witch,1,2018-10-05 01:06:07

Imagine this, you're 15 years young

Life as you know it has barely begun.

You have some great friends, or so you think

When one of them invites you to a house to drink.

It seems harmless enough, it could be fun

As soon as you're through the door, they start feeding you rum.

Your head is spinning, your face feels hot

But at least you have friends near... Or so you thought.

Two leave for a smoke, two leave for other plans

And before you know it, you're left alone with one man.

The two of you talk, just an innocent chat

But then, ""You know for 15, you've got a great rack"".

The room starts to spin, you find it hard to move

Where the hell are your friends who said they'd be back soon?

He half drags you down the hall, this must be a prank

But he unbuttons his pants... And the whole world goes blank.

You wake to a dark room, in a stranger's bed

You remember what happened and feel nothing but dread.

Why did everyone insist he was ""such a cool guy""

Terry Crews has become my overnight hero/My personal experience,24,8uy9vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8uy9vn/terry_crews_has_become_my_overnight_heromy/,1,1530320631.0,"I‚Äôve always loved Terry since white girls, but have mostly written him off as a meat-head, roid junkie; judging him at face value. After watching his testimony, he‚Äôs become an overnight hero for me. I‚Äôm a guy, I turn 30 next Tuesday, and throughout my early to late teens I was sexually abused by a member of my family; My father. Somewhere in the middle of that timeframe he also attempted to molest me, one drunken night, only stopping because I woke up with his hand halfway down my pants. He attempted to wait until I fell asleep, drunkenly thinking I hadn‚Äôt noticed what he was doing. Even coming back in while I, terrified under my covers, not knowing what to do, pretended to sleep. Each time he came back in and removed my covers I pretended to stir, not really knowing what to do but not wanting to be touched until he left back into the living room. Seeing my only chance I ran upstairs into my parents bedroom, telling my mother what happened. She told me to sleep with her for the night and she went downstairs to see what my father was doing, to which he responded ‚Äúlooking for a pillow‚Äù in my room. The next day I told my brother who didn‚Äôt know how to react. Then later that day was told by my mother to not be ridiculous that he was just looking for a pillow, to which I just stayed quiet. 

In terms of the years of sexual abuse, we had only one bathroom at the time, it had a crack between the moulding and a reflective marble door saddle, which you could see the inside of the bathroom from the outside if you stood close enough. Before the night that changed me forever, I had heard my father stand by the door many times not knowing why; Afterwards I realized. I developed a ritual each time I bathed after that, in order to cover myself. See, he knew exactly when to get up because I tried to catch him in the act to let him know that I knew. So he would wait until the water turned on... waited until he heard the curtain closed.. waited until the water was off and the curtain was reopened. He knew I wouldn‚Äôt leave the bathroom until I was dressed so he would use that opportunity to unstealthily go to the door. So this ritual I developed was to hold the towel just-so, to both dry myself quickly and cover my modesty, while the boards creaked outside of the door under his weight. (He was sporting a high 200 - 300 lbs at the time) Later I also mentioned this to my mother, to which she confronted him with a ‚Äúare you watching them?‚Äù To which he replied with an obvious no, his word being more valuable than mine. 

Now my brother ‚Äúforgot‚Äù that I ever told him, and it was only brought up in fights as adults. He too was abused, but refuses to this day to believe my father watched him in the bath. I was the first, and last, attempt at molestation for my father, so my brother never went through what I did. In the fights where the molestation was brought up I‚Äôve always said ‚Äúour father molested me‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhe attempted to molest me‚Äù with today‚Äôs culture, and knowing how family driven we are (were Puerto Rican: family ALWAYS comes first) I knew that an attempt would not be seen as being as traumatizing as the actual contact. Maybe this was wrong of me, but to this day I‚Äôve stuck to my guns, calling it a full molestation. 

My parents got a divorce (unrelated) then were remarried years later. During the divorce period my mother finally decided that ‚Äúit could be possible he did this to you‚Äù as she found out from my uncle that my father was molested as a child. After the second marriage it was never mentioned again. I have been an outcast, a black sheep in my family for years because of this, and I‚Äôve resented them all for not believing me. 

I‚Äôve felt so betrayed and abandoned by my family and have never forgiven them for this; but until now I mostly buried it in the back of my head. I never had the courage or the words to stand up for myself and put my trauma over the ‚Äúfamily first‚Äù motto. But Terry stood up to his abusers, and disbelievers and I honestly believe that Because of this; Terry is the definition of what a man is, or should strive to be. Forget the beer chugging, chest pounding, knuckle dragging ideation of manhood that exists today. A man should be defined as: An individual who can recognize what is right, and do it; no matter the cost. Terry gave up a multi million dollar contract in the expendables 4 to make his testimony, possibly being blacklisted, being view as a ‚Äúman‚Äù. He‚Äôs brought back some unwanted memories for me, but maybe it‚Äôs for the better. I hope we all strive to be better like Terry. 

Thanks for your time, allowing me to vent, if anyone else has had this experience, I hope you find peace. ",24,0,meToo,Odd-dog88,1,2018-06-30 04:03:51

An open letter to my rapist,22,7uw7um,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7uw7um/an_open_letter_to_my_rapist/,8,1517620788.0,"An open letter to my rapist,
      I don‚Äôt know your name. All I remember is that you were a lawyer, which is ironic. I vaguely remember meeting you at a bar in Belltown in Seattle. Your friends joined my friends at our table as we drank. As the night went on, I don‚Äôt remember much, just bits and pieces. I remember that I passed out in the bathroom of the bar. I remember you coming in to get me. Everyone else left. My friends ditched me. You took it upon yourself to take me back to your apartment and you took advantage of me at my weakest and most vulnerable. I remember waking up the next morning. I remember you touching me. I still didn‚Äôt remember your name. You forced yourself upon me. Not knowing what you were capable of and having nobody know where I was, I didn‚Äôt actually say no. I was terrified. I wholeheartedly believe I said no with my body language, but I felt no other choice but to go along with it for my safety. Not only did I have to realize you raped me that night, but you used your power to have your way with me the morning after while I was sober. I will never forget that feeling of powerlessness over my body. It took so much of me to not burst into tears, but again, I was so scared. I knew nothing about you except the fact that you preyed on me the night before. I stood in your apartment overlooking Lake Union as you got ready for work and then sent me on my way out of your home. I had no money. No phone. I had to figure out where I was and find my way home doing the walk of shame and replaying the little memories of the night that I had.
	I want you to know that what you did still haunts me. The fact that you were a predator and took advantage of a young 21 year old woman after you found her passed out on a bathroom floor speaks volumes as to who you are as a person. I wish I remembered your name. I wish I could remember your face, but after 9 years, I have worked hard to block out these memories until this #metoo movement started. 
	You see, as painful as it is to revisit these difficult memories, it is completely necessary so that women gain more strength and power by using their voice. I said nothing back then because I knew nobody would believe me. I didn‚Äôt think anyone would believe a 21 year old girl who went out drinking was raped by a lawyer. Hell, look at all the women who came forward about Larry Nassar. It took SO many women - SO SO many women before anyone gave them the time of day. This needs to change. Our voices need to be heard. 
	So to my rapist, you no longer have power over me. I am done blaming myself. I am done using the excuse that it was my fault because I drank too much. No. This is not okay. It is not okay to prey on women when they are weak. You help them get a cab (or uber now, I guess), and send them home. You don‚Äôt fucking rape them. 
     This is my voice. I am finally sharing my story. I know you‚Äôll probably never actually read this letter, but I hope that this gives other women the courage to come forward if something like this has happened to them. Seek justice. I sure wish I had. ",22,0,meToo,autumnsmom,1,2018-02-03 04:19:48

My #metoo story,20,9n0b75,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9n0b75/my_metoo_story/,4,1539184267.0,"When I was 16, my best friend (15f) and I were having a sleepover at my house. My stepfather was in the kitchen with us while we talked about stupid stuff that I don‚Äôt remember. My stepfather asked if we had ever had alcohol before. My best friend said yes, she loved drinking, which was true. I said no, because I had never drunk before. A few minutes later, he put a glass of orange juice in front of me. I like orange juice, so I drank it even though I hadn‚Äôt asked for it. 
I finished the entire glass of it and felt dizzy. My best friend realized something was wrong and yelled at my stepfather, asking what he did. I was giggly and couldn‚Äôt walk in a straight line. My stepfather had given me a solo cup that was two-thirds vodka and one third orange juice. I was also on a medication at the time that happened to intensify the effects of alcohol. 
My best friend and stepfather took me downstairs and made me eat burnt toast. Then my best friend went to the bathroom. While she was using the bathroom, my stepfather asked me to flash him. He wanted to see my tits. I told him now and he reached out to grab me, but he didn‚Äôt do it because my best friend had left the bathroom and was coming back. 
I learned a few months ago that my stepfather was harassing my best friend from the ages of 15 to 18. He would knock on my bedroom door while she was still at my house and I was at work with his dick out and ask her for sex. He would encourage us to wear shorter skirts and shorts. He made inappropriate comments and would walk in on me while I was showering. 
I left that house back in May. I told my mother everything because she had discovered that he was having numerous affairs. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll ever leave him, but she hasn‚Äôt left him yet.

I was raped in college,18,8y9tar,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8y9tar/i_was_raped_in_college/,18,1531402445.0,"Let me start out by saying that I am a man, and a gay man at that, but I was raped by a woman shortly after accepting the fact that maybe I was not straight. I was depressed because I didn't want to be gay. I was in a fraternity, and I just thought that being gay in a fraternity would be weird. My fraternity supported me immensely through it though. I love those guys. But one night before I told some of them I got very, very drunk. Not quite blackout, but close. This girl who is in a sorority was hanging out with me and a couple other guys. She didn't drink. After I get blasted she takes me outside behind a building close by and pulls down my pants. I was uncomfortable and didn't want her to. I said no a few times but gave up because I couldn't even walk at this point. We had sex in the snow. I was a virgin at that point, but not anymore. I wanted my first time to be with another guy that I could trust. Now what bothers me more than anything else, is how all these people knew about it, didn't stop it, and it became a joke. The next day she came over and asked if I wanted to hang out. I said ""What, so you can rape me again?"" And everyone laughed. If I was a woman and she was a guy then she would be labeled a monster, kicked out of college, and arrested. But apparently to most people women can't rape men.The double standard pisses me off so much. If I took advantage of a drunk girl like she took advantage of me, everyone would hate me. And if I ever complained about it people told me to ""man up"" and ""quit being a pussy"". This double standard needs to end. Just because I am a guy doesn't mean I can't get raped by a woman, and it sure as hell doesn't invalidate my right to be fucking pissed. I find this whole situation similar to news stories where teachers sleep with students. If it's a male teacher sleeping with a female student, people want him dead or in ptison for life. If it's an attractive female teacher sleeping with a male student, people are like ""Good for that kid! Wish I had a teacher like that!"" NO! NONONONONO! WOMEN CAN BE RAPISTS TOO! I get men are statistically more likely to rape than women, but it doesn't change the fact that I was raped by a woman. This double standard needs to go. I'm sick of it.

#MeToo From a Male Perspective,19,7vxd47,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7vxd47/metoo_from_a_male_perspective/,2,1518021588.0,"I can't speak for anyone else, only myself. 

I don't know if anyone else felt this way at the shock and outrage over the MeToo movement, but I remember, amongst the horror, I felt anger. Yes, for the rapists. But also for people who were shocked. Surprised. Who didn't know such things went on in Hollywood, or daily life. I was angry at them, too. I thought... 'You SERIOUSLY didn't know how bad this is?'.

I was 14 the first time a friend told me they'd been raped. In retrospect I think I've always been easy to talk to, who listens, who's approachable. I realise now it's not really the norm for women to feel like they can talk openly and honestly with men, but for whatever reason they've felt that way with me.

I remember the shock, the horror I felt as I listened to her graphic description of being held down, raped, burnt with cigarettes. I'd never heard anything like this. And most importantly, I hadn't experienced anything in my own life as a man or boy that I could compare it to. I think that's why a lot of men struggle to empathise. They don't hear about it, they don't experience it, they can't understand it in relation to their own life.

It took me a lot of time, listening to my friend, the descriptions of the violence, the behaviour, her feelings then and now. I understood it on its own terms, not mine. But it took me time. She's doing great now, and says that my support through that time was a vital part of her getting through it, so that helps to salve my feeling of hopelessness, the idea that I could help, in some small way. Still, it's not much by comparison to what she went through.

Then something odd started happening, to me. Within a year, now 15, another friend told me she had been raped. She told me, out of the blue. And I listened. I supported. I sat through the horror all over again and said nothing about how I felt. For anyone who counsels a friend through this, I think that's good advice. This was all a daily ritual. It was not a single conversation, for either of my friends. It was day after day after day, for years now. That's what gets a friend through this; being there. Not having been there once.

That year another friend confessed to me that she had been raped. Next year it was another two. And it continued. That was 11 years ago. The number of friends, family and partners who have been raped now stands at 21. I keep count. And I remember them all. Half of those, I was the first person they told. Five told their parents. Three the police. Only one had their rapist arrested and imprisoned. He's already out now.

Now about every 8 months someone close to me tells me about their experience being raped. I have seen, in the long term, the damage that does to a person. Their life is fractured, broken, able only to reknit into a deformed, twisted version of what it was meant to be. I have grown up seeing people I love unravel like this, and I know without a doubt that there is no act of violence more damaging than rape.

One friend was 13 years old when she was pulled into a van and gang-raped by five men. My step-mother was abducted, stripped naked, chained to the floor in a collar and forced to eat from the dog bowl as he raped her over a period of 8 hours. He assembled knives and barbed wire and described how, when he was done with her, he would execute her. My girlfriend was raped habitually by her father from the age of about 8 until he was too infirm to continue, about ten years later. Then she took care of him until he died. She told me she used to be stoned by the local bullies on her way home from school, and would still drag her feet because she knew the real abuse waited for her at home.

Even with MeToo's massive push recently, I haven't heard any stories like this in the media. We don't hear the worst. And we aren't reminded often enough that this happens EVERYWHERE, not just Hollywood. It's hard not to feel hopeless. I've been hearing these stories since I was a kid myself, and it's hard living with that knowledge. But not as hard as it for the victims to live with. So I know how lucky I am. 

But rape has touched almost every best friend, family member and partner I've ever had. I was not shocked when the news came out, and I still feel angry at those who were. How so much suffering can persist without so many people knowing is beyond me. When a female friend tells me she's never been harassed or raped... That's when I'm surprised. I often feel that if you're a woman, you are guaranteed to experience it at some point in your life.

In truth, I'm heartbroken, permanently, knowing how much suffering is out there. But I am hopeful. A lot of people are painfully ignorant of this, but they're learning. A lot of rapists have hurt a lot of people, but they're being taken down. And a lot of victims are hurting, but they are being listened to.

If you are a victim yourself, just know that millions of people can feel your pain, and hear your voice. None of us can give back what was taken from you, but we are here to help, to support, to listen. And I know that a male friend is an unlikely choice for a confidant, but we are out here too. You might be discovering now that far more people are ready to be there for you than you could have imagined.

My perspective is not one of a victim, but I think it's important to hear. I struggle to hope, a lot. It's hard not to fear for others around me. And I find myself silently waiting to hear confession number 22 with a pained sense of dread.

But I'm always here to listen. And victim or not, the rest of us should all be ready to do the same. Because that's the only antidote to this kind of pain.",19,0,meToo,TheCreasyBear,1,2018-02-07 19:39:48

Struggling with a bad eating disorder, depression, anxiety.. I was naive, kind, and innocent. I met him and we had an instant connection. I was at tennis camp for the first time that summer and had a big crush on him. I mean, I‚Äôm sure other people go to summer camps and think a counselor is cute... but it usually doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. He was 19, almost 20. We became friends at my first tennis camp, but hadn‚Äôt actually started talking until my second camp of the summer. I went back to camp 2 months later and within those 2 months we added eachother on Snapchat and I assumed we were just going to be friends...Anyway, he started flirting with me and he convinced me to tell him everything about me. My struggles, mental health, eating issues, and family problems. He knew I didn‚Äôt have any friends. So he decided to be my only friend. He knew I was young and innocent, that‚Äôs why I was the perfect prey. He used the ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù tactic on me, like most predators do with their prey. He manipulated me, and changed me completely. My eating disorder worsened and he played mind games with me. I was so naive that I didn‚Äôt think any of this was wrong. He was so kind to me and friendly until he got horny and needed something from me. We would hang out some times.. singing, playing tennis, getting frozen yogurt.. when One night at the end of the summer, we were driving around and he told me to get in the back seat of the car. I had no choice. My parents had no idea that I had a ‚Äúthing‚Äù with this older guy and that he had been my first kiss. I was miles away from home and I thought he was my friend so he would never hurt me.. right? I got in the back and he started doing things to me that I didn‚Äôt know were real. He unbuttoned my pants and took my shirt off and put his hands in places that they didn‚Äôt belong. After an hour I was in so much pain.. he looked to me and said, ‚ÄúI enjoyed the fuck outta that‚Äù. I thought to myself, ‚Äúwhy did that hurt? It shouldn‚Äôt hurt.. but that must be  normal. He‚Äôs my best friend, he would never hurt me. He loves me. He told me he loves me. This is what love is‚Äù I was wrong. After that night he never met up with me in person again, except once a couple months later when we ran into eachother one day. What he physically did to me hurt, but what he said to me verbally over Snapchat throughout the year hurt more. But I never questioned it, because he always made up for it with his compliments and ‚Äúlove‚Äù. It took me a full year to realize what he did was wrong and vile, and that the things he said to me were the opposite of loving.  The next summer I went back to tennis camp and he was still working there, pretending like nothing had happened. We hadn‚Äôt talked in a month and I had finally realized that he was a predator. I reported him to his employer and am now dealing with the court case. The law system has been extremely slow, as I reported in August and have made no progress since then. Anyway..it takes time, but don‚Äôt let your voice be silenced by those who hurt you. You are strong, resilient, beautiful, worthy, enough, and a badass.

I just lost the case against the man who sexually assaulted/harassed me.,20,8m48kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8m48kg/i_just_lost_the_case_against_the_man_who_sexually/,20,1527274828.0,"Pretty much what the title says...

The past 2 months have been an ongoing investigation at work to try and fire this guy  (almost 10 years older than me - I'm 18) for harassing me and touching me unsolicitedly. 

For 2 months or so he nagged me into submitting to showing him suggestive pictures of me in lingerie or naked - pictures I have kept for my partner's uses. He never listened when I told him ""no I don't want to"", instead telling me that ""you know you want to"" and other things along those lines. I have a history of being forced into something I didn't want to do from an ex-partner and a few years afterwards from a friend of a friend, so I'm not very strong against standing up to sexual encounters. 

This guy would isolate me and touch and smack my ass, grab my breasts and lift up my shirt when I didn't want him to. I finally worked up the courage to report him, wrote my statement including exact dates, potential CCTV and witnesses but I lost...

I lost. This was more than just a chance to win over him. It was a chance to finally empower myself (besides the very trusting intercourse I have with my partner because he makes me feel valued and respected - wholeheartedly, he's a sweetheart) by bringing him to justice and finally getting some kind of victory for my sexually abusive history. 

I'm going to get a new job... But it could take a while and I can't be unemployed while looking for a new one. So I must suck it up and work beside my assaulter/harasser until I can leave.

Edit: just wanted to thank everyone who has replied so far and anyone else who will. Discussing this with you guys is helping so much to clear my head and slow down and reassess the situation in a not-so-doomed light. I hope that those of you with cases of your own win them if you are currently fighting one and that you can learn to push through this struggle and reclaim yourself whether or not you've won a case, lost a case are currently in dispute,or haven't spoken up. Whether you have one incident of sexual abuse or many: well some to all of you for getting through this even enough to be here and seeing this post today. Thank you and stay strong!

Update: my uncle may be able to get me transferred to another store. He is friends with a manager at a nearby branch of the fast food company I work for. The manager is going to try and get me transferred or push for my store to get back on the case and fight against the legal firm! 

Update 2 (final): I feel it's needed. The man who did this quit his job about a month or so ago as a result of the case. I am happy at work now and am pushing myself forward in my training to work up the ranks as far as I can! Besides the passing memories and ocassional mentions of the man's name, I don't remember that this situation ever happened. I'm not completely over it as being used in any way is quite disheartening to say the least. However I want to use this as an example that it is possible to move on from events in your life that happen; be they sexual or not. I know that my situation was not as bad as others here man have experienced and so they will be more difficult to overcome. But difficult does not mean impossible.

Raising Awareness: Mozambique Police Corruption and Cover-Up,20,a7qv9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a7qv9j/raising_awareness_mozambique_police_corruption/,0,1545255407.0,"I am currently having my story shared in the Australian and British press (such as¬†Sunday Heraldand¬†Scottish Sun) with regards to the murder investigation of Elly Warren. The Australian Federal Government will hopefully now push for an investigation into the Mozambique death of Elly Warren due partly to me sharing my own experience of dangers and police corruption of Tofo Beach, Mozambique. I am now in desperate need for your help to make future tourists, especially female, aware of these dangers. I am finding those in authority are desperately trying to protect the tourist industry of Tofo Beach at all costs, including covering up a murder and attempted rape. ¬†¬†

Apologies, there are many intricate components to this full story but let me try to explain.¬†

In 2010, I was involved in a serious incident metres from where Elly's body was found. To summarise, a Tofo¬†police officer¬†tried to rape and threatened to kill me. Thankfully I was able to escape. I then went to the police station, not knowing that my attacker was a police officer, to report the incident. At the police station, I identified my attacker who then proceeded to try to frame me with drug possession and told the other officers I had been resisting arrest when witnesses found me struggling with him. I was then held at gun point until bribe money was accepted and I was able to escape (for the second time in one night). The following days after this incident, I met with security representatives from the Mozambique Tourist Board and the British High Commissioner. I was continuously told to drop the case and be thankful that I wasn't being arrested, but I was determined to get justice. With two British Consular delegates present, I was able to identify my attacker and two other police officers involved. The day I returned home, I received a phone call to tell me the the police officer that had tried to attack me had lost his job, and more serious consequences were forthcoming. 

I was contacted a few weeks ago (20th of November) by the investigation team of Elly Warren due to our terrifying similarities. They had found a TripAdvisor post from 2010 that an eye-witness had written and were remarkably able to track me down. Elly was found dead in Tofo Beach in 2016, and has had a botched investigation due to the Mozambique police changing and concealing evidence. I am now directly working with Elly's family to fight for her justice and with the Australian Coroner's Court, providing them evidence such as secret audio recordings made from the police station. 

Upon learning of Elly's death, I immediately contacted the current Maputo British High Commissioner office for the names of the officers involved with my incident, but unfortunately, they have been less than helpful. I was coldly told they do not have the data for the case files from 2010 and they can also not tell me the names of the UK Officials working at that time. I have since been told this is because of the Data Protection Act. However, it still terrifies me for the potential reasons that the current British High Commissioner would know nothing about my incident: ¬†

  - That this is a normal occurrence: Tofo police rape tourists regularly so my case wasn't special
  - My case was hidden away to protect the tourist industry of Tofo Beach
  - No one actually did get fired and I was just told that so I would drop the case¬†

I believe the authorities who knew of my incident and didn't act, need to be held to some accountability for the murder of Elly Warren.¬† The tour company that I was with during my time in Africa also contacted me last week asking me not to publicise my story as I could prevent visitors going to Tofo. However, if the police cannot be trusted or are still a danger, then I have to draw awareness to this in case more woman suffer. ¬†

To clarify, I am not trying to single-handedly take on Mozambique's police corporation. At this stage, I just think it is in the upmost importance that I spread awareness for the safety of future tourists of Tofo. Although Mozambique is known for it's dangers, we are led to believe that Tofo Beach is a tourist paradise, a safe haven. From my experience, it appears that no authorities involved want to burst that paradise bubble.¬†People need to know that their daughters, sisters, and friends may not come home and no one will be willing to help them when that happens.¬†",20,0,meToo,sarahhayrikyan,1,2018-12-20 00:36:47

What do you do when it happened so many years ago?,18,9pdz5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9pdz5z/what_do_you_do_when_it_happened_so_many_years_ago/,2,1539901885.0,"Hello all,

I experienced an incident 12 years ago.  Heads up- I'm going to describe the incident, but not go into a lot of graphic detail. 

My ex deliberately broke my boundaries during sex and said he was doing it cause he kind of hates me. I didn't say anything. I didn't know how to feel. We were breaking up at the time and he was angry at me. I kind of didn't want the sex at all and gave in to pressure. Then he deliberately violated a stated boundary while verbally acknowledging he was doing it. I stopped talking to him soon after that and moved far away but never acknowledged the incident. A year later he contacted me and threatened suicide if we didn't get back together. He also described how he was going to put his cats to sleep unless I moved back and tried again with him. And I said no but told him to get help and I hoped he felt better. I never told him how manipulative cruel and messed up he was being.

So now, 12 years later after much therapy and emotional growth, my anger about these incidents has surfaced and I don't know what to do with it. In a normal situation, I'd just tell the person, ""What you did was messed up, etc."" But this is so many years later. Is there any point? Plus I'm really not interested in anything he has to say. Best case scenario would be an apology and I just can't bring myself to want to hear it. Worst case will be some kind of argument about how I was wrong too, blah blah. I mean, yes I didn't break up with him gracefully and I could have been better in a lot of ways. But I did not violate his sexual boundary. He did that, so....

I don't know exactly what I want to get out of it except for having a voice. Like, I don't think my pointing it out will change his behavior if he hasn't changed on his own in all this time. Also, he blocked me from his life and social media after he theatened sucide ‚Äãand I didn't move back to be with him. 

I just hope to hear from others who experienced something a long time ago. Did you confront the person after all that time? If you did, did it give you any satisfaction? How else did/do you deal with the anger?

This is not just about sexual assault.,16,9jpv0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9jpv0g/this_is_not_just_about_sexual_assault/,14,1538161962.0,"I‚Äôve never been traumatically sexually assaulted. More like endlessly groped, insulted, etc... especially in the halls of high school. 

Then my ex husband became an abusive drug addict and I left six months into it. Even though I‚Äôd  left him I wasn‚Äôt able to escape for three years because of a judge. 

He refused to grant me no contact when picking up and dropping off the kids. This was in large part due to his mom and a slimy lawyer. I had no lawyer. I had no money. 

I was in three years of hell. Most cops wouldn‚Äôt take me seriously because he kept testing clean. A cop he went to high school with let him dump some drugs on the side of the road so he‚Äôd get in less trouble after being arrested for hitting me. It was just a punch to the arm but he‚Äôd been at my house refusing to leave for three days and I was done. 

It wasn‚Äôt until he was finally arrested on weapons charges that I was allowed to leave the state with my kids after three years of 30 to 50 texts and calls daily. Trolling my house. Refusing to pick up and drop off the kids. Ripping the dash out of my car one night. Endless insanity. 

By that time I was broken. I‚Äôm still broken. Thankfully he‚Äôs sober and making amends and able to be there for his kids.  

This is why I‚Äôm so insanely upset over this hearing. I can‚Äôt stop crying and feel so crazy and upset.

So no I‚Äôve never been officially sexually assaulted but was systematically abused by the system set up to protect me. 

My ex got sober within six months of having his kids taken away. Keeping family‚Äôs together is not always the way to go.

I can forgive my kids dad because he‚Äôs gone above and beyond to make it up to me but I can never forgive our legal or law enforcement system. Ever.

If there‚Äôs a better place for this or a more appropriate hash tag let me know. 
I think it‚Äôs less about the specific type of incident and more about being utterly powerless at the hands of abusive men. ",16,0,meToo,wellsfargosucksass,1,2018-09-28 22:12:42

Is the #metoo movement becoming a witchhunt?,17,7pp9so,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7pp9so/is_the_metoo_movement_becoming_a_witchhunt/,17,1515688262.0,"I realize this wont be a popular point of view for some people but i think this need to be talked about.

So the ""Me too"" movement is something that is all around us now. When it first came out, all the men that were shown to be the way they were was a good think for the most part such as what happened with louis CK and other famous people.

Over the past week however, i seen people which as Stan Lee and now recently James Franco. There comes a point where you have to rethink if what is really happening is just being abused. Lets look at these 2

1. Stan lee is 95 years old, why are these coming out now?!? Do we not realize old people are just the way they are and its shouldnt be anything. You know what you are dealing with when Stan lee plays a Strip Club DJ in Deadpool. 

2. James Franco- This came out not to long ago. I watched his interview on seth meyers and Colbert's and i can read that he for sure is aware of what happened. James Franco is a hot name right now and its human nature to Drag people down for money, just like the Stan lee example. 

The confusing thing which is happening is that what do we define what the difference between Flirting and what someone would call ""sexual harassment"" This line between these two have become blurry and thats a dangerous hole to go down. I just feel like some people will abuse this victimizing tactic against people who are rich.  We need to look at each case and not paint all people as sick because that will destroy the social life between us and make it harder to live life.  Let me know your thoughts because there comes a point where you have to have second thoughts. ",17,0,meToo,xlegendarypete,1,2018-01-11 19:31:02
"The gross ""contest"" that was broken up at my son's school",15,agtkp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/agtkp6/the_gross_contest_that_was_broken_up_at_my_sons/,5,1547695859.0,"I thought the next generation of boys we're raising could accept the challenge of being more respectful of women than the last one, and the one before that. That may be true, but they are trend followers, and you as a parent may be the only resistance to some of the behavior they encounter at school.
I had an interesting conversation with my high school freshman son about an issue that moved the needle on sexual assault in his school in the past week. Apparently, a small bra-unhooking competition broke out, at first among a few popular guys on girls who considered them friends, then it spread to unsuspecting girls sitting in front of those boys in class or even in the hallways. Picture random attacks by the offending dudes just aggressively sticking their hands up girls' backs, I guess. They got many innocent bystanders (an awful phrase because this was clear sexual assault on all of the girls involved, regardless of whether they were ""in"" on the ""joke"" at the beginning), and so many girls were walking around on high alert in case it happened to them. 
Well, thankfully the main perpetrators couldn't slink around doing it forever, and the dean of students called them in individually and let them know how goddamn disgusting it was. I'm not aware whether anyone got suspended (I hope so), but there was official discipline, apparently. But the damage is already done.
My son said incredulously called it ""drive-by harassment,"" but here's what he said in earnest when I asked him if he had learned anything. [Paraphrasing here] ""They saw it as no big deal, or an immature prank at worst. It potentially tarnished those guys' reputations forever. If someone was running around pantsing guys in public, they would get punched. If you invade people's personal space, the gloves come off.""
So be aware that even though, god willing, your son's head may be screwed on straight, the culture and friends that are influencing him may be telling him violating women's bodies is no big deal. It turns out your son's friends still may not realize the seriousness of something like putting their hand on a woman's bra. I wonder where they were in school on the day they learned ""keep your hands to yourself"" and what part of that did not get through to them.

This movement is bringing up depressive thoughts. 

I don't want to go into details of my rape, but it ruined my life for several months and years. It took time and counseling to get over my self hate and to finally get past this horrific event. I have moved on...I have a successful career, an amazing man, in graduate school, and on most days my depression/anxiety is under check. Now, 9 years later this #MeToo movement is here. I can't explain it well, but this movement has completely triggered terrible emotions and feelings. I don't want to feel forced to bring up old wounds. I don't want this pressure. I don't think about what happen to me. This is my choice. This is how I cope with what happened to me now. 

I want to tell people to careful with your words during this movement. To say people are too scared to post is not always true. Some people just don't want to share their stories on Facebook.  This is a very painful time for many people and it's just may be a trigger.

"I was the ""Perfect Victim"", and I still couldn't report. Trigger warning.",14,9mlogq,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9mlogq/i_was_the_perfect_victim_and_i_still_couldnt/,3,1539055185.0,"This is a throwaway account, in part because of some of the details, and in part because I don't feel my voice should overstep other voices.   


I was in the US Army Infantry. I was young, only 21. I'm a bisexual white male. It was 2008 the first time, and 2009 the second.   


Both times, the narrative would have been as believable and palatable as any apologist could ask for.   


White, male. Infantry, a man's man (although being bisexual would have cut into that, but they still couldn't have questioned it too much.) Neither time made it past an attempt, because being young, fit, and in training, I was too dangerous for that. And what conservative doesn't like the narrative of people in the LGBTQ community being predatory? Of course, this is only two interactions out of thousands, but they'd still lap it up. Too bad I could never tell.  


The first time, a friend's boyfriend came onto me, kind of strong. I'd never met him before, we're all at the club, he was shitfaced, I was fairly drunk, but still in control of my faculties. I remember roughly who was at the club that night, but not specifically. I don't remember which of my friends from my unit were there, if any, or if I was just out with my civilian friends. I couldn't tell you the time of year at this point, it's been fucking forever.   


Anyways, he decided he wanted a threesome, I don't remember if he knew I'd slept with his girlfriend or just decided I looked appetizing. I said no. That was around the time he grabbed me, tried to pull me in and kiss me. In public, in a military town, while I was military. I nearly broke his wrist stopping that advance, and explained in no uncertain terms if he tried to force himself on me again, I'd break every bone in his body. He wouldn't even look at me the rest of the night, although I avoided him after that.   


The second time, I was at a party. It was a convention, a hotel, and I was in a safe space, with people I was actually out to. I was drinking, having a great time. I wasn't under constant pressure not to be myself. And then a guy followed me into the bathroom, and went to grab me. I shoved him off, told him hell no. It was barely assaulty, but it was wildly inappropriate. He thought, just because I was bisexual and out to him, it meant I wanted to fuck. I didn't. I got called a cocktease by several people before giving up on the party.   


See, here's the thing. I'm a ""perfect victim"". I can't imagine any rape apologist seeing any problems in these stories at all. And yet, I never did report either of these attempts to anyone. Don't ask don't tell was still a thing, and the toxic masculinity would have had me guilty by association (ignore the fact that I'm actually bisexual, that's DADT for you, it's supposed to be as long as nobody knows, you're good). But I would have been out of the Army without any benefits in record time.   


I can tell you some of the details. Both times I was drinking but not drunk. One of the times, I'd dressed kinda slutty, to be totally fair, but that was for me. Neither made it past an attempt. And reporting would have destroyed my life.   


If I couldn't report, where the hell do people get off questioning anyone else who doesn't?

I was sexually assaulted by my grandfather three years ago,14,8x70be,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8x70be/i_was_sexually_assaulted_by_my_grandfather_three/,0,1531102260.0,"My grandfather had been my father figure my whole life. My mom and I moved in with my grandparents when I was three years old, and we lived there until I started high school. When we lived there, he drank excessively (he‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic) and would throw things or yell if he came home and the house wasn‚Äôt cleaned to his standard. He never touched me though. He‚Äôs very successful in his career path and has come up from being poor to being very wealthy. He is respected by many.

Fast forward to 30-year-old me. I had just separated from my then-husband and was finally free from that abusive and manipulative relationship. I decided I wanted to come out to my family, mainly because I didn‚Äôt want them to be surprised if I started dating a woman (I‚Äôm bi). Well apparently my grandfather took this some fucked-up-kind-of-way and decided to try and pull my strapless dress down one evening. He then hugged me close and tried to put his tongue in my mouth. I have never felt so disgusted and disgusting at the same time. I was staying at my grandparents‚Äô house since I was in town visiting for a week, so I hurried upstairs and locked myself in the bedroom. 

I told my grandma what had happened and she told me ‚Äúwell you shouldn‚Äôt have told him that you‚Äôre bisexual, now he sees you as a sexual object.‚Äù I told my mom, and she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù until I reminded her a few months ago when she was guilt tripping me about why I don‚Äôt want to talk to him on the phone or visit. She hasn‚Äôt talked about it or brought it up since.

I just feel really....confused. Violated. Uncomfortable. Shitty. If any of my children ever come to me with something, ANYTHING, I could never forget or leave them in the wind. I‚Äôd do whatever I could to show that I‚Äôm on their side and that they did nothing wrong. 

This isn‚Äôt my first time being sexually assaulted or harassed, but it‚Äôs the one time that fucks with me the most.

"How #MeToo helped me escape an abusive relationship, and believe in myself.",16,7wh0kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7wh0kq/how_metoo_helped_me_escape_an_abusive/,8,1518213839.0,"My oppressive, emotionally and physically abusive soon-to-be ex-husband has just served me divorce papers seeking 1/3 of my salary because he suffers from this chronic illness known as ‚Äúunemployment‚Äù that, in this situation, resulted from his status as a lazy pot-head. What he curiously omitted from his sworn statements summarizing his assets was the $175,000 in marital property that is sitting in his account from an injury that left him lying on a couch in my apartment for more than a year while I was in law school AND supporting him financially, emotionally, and physically. He also left out the fact that he is a beneficiary of a trust valued at more than $100,000. He also left out the assets and income from multiple businesses he started with my guidance, support and assistance. Yet me, a girl who has worked her ass off in spite of his constant efforts to suppress her growth and in spite of his efforts to isolate her from her friends and family, who works 80+ hours per week just to live paycheck to paycheck, who was finally able to build up enough courage and strength to remove herself from an abusive situation, who was finally able to recognize that she deserved better than his constant berating and violent outbreaks, should go homeless to ensure that an ‚Äúunemployed‚Äù lazy pot-head can keep his a fancy one bedroom with a yard in a highly sought after urban neighborhood. 

Husband, I wanted to do this amicably. We could have made it through this heartbreak to our mutual benefit. I was willing to give you everything in exchange for your helping me furnish a tiny studio apartment. The value of such furnishings pale in comparison to the value of the property I was going to let you keep in exchange for allowing me to break free smoothly. I was going to let you keep my puppy. I was even willing to keep your physical and emotional abuse quiet, as you said you would get help and you seemed genuinely remorseful. I didn‚Äôt want your past mistakes to haunt you forever. 

During the first few weeks of our separation, you seemed on board with my hopes for an amicable resolution. We enjoyed two wonderful shows and a number of candid conversations that were more honest than any of our communications over the past 8 years had ever been. For one foolish moment I thought you might be able to change, and we could salvage some sort of relationship moving forward. You would end your controlling and violent ways, and I would achieve my full potential without your interference. You would learn what it‚Äôs like to have empathy for another human being that you claim to love, and I would learn to speak up for myself. You would control your violent, nonsensical outbursts, and I would consider trusting you again. 

The fight-free period that you promised could continue forever if I gave you one more chance ended after less than a month. Out of the blue you accuse me of having an affair with my boss during our marriage based on two photos of two different women sucking cock that you found on Craigslist. One of the women had massive boobs. I appreciate you thinking so highly of my life-long A-cups, but no. The other had no body fat and a ring the quarter of the size of the one you gave me when you claimed you wanted to stand by my side for life. Again, I wish my many, cheese-filled rolls didn‚Äôt exist, and I wish I didn‚Äôt have to nearly amputate my finger attempting to remove that hideous rock, but again, no. You became enraged by images that were clearly not me because you convinced yourself, once again, that you‚Äôve never done anything wrong and that all of our problems‚Äîincluding your rage‚Äîare my fault.

I must say, your deflection skills are impressive. They had me thinking I was crazy and horrible for years before I realized that no, a man who truly cares about a woman shouldn‚Äôt be enraged when his own, admittedly wrong actions make that woman cry. Yet every time we would fight, every time you would call me names and threaten to kill me or throw me out of a moving car or burn the apartment to the ground with me and our animals in it, I ended up locking myself in the bathroom in an attempt to not just protect myself, but to stifle my sobs in a stack of towels. Towels that you would later yell at me for getting needlessly dirty or because I failed to return said towels to their proper shelf. But that type of yelling was preferable. The type of yelling you‚Äôd do if you heard me cry was intolerable.

These types of fights didn‚Äôt start happening until after our engagement. Slowly but surely, they became more frequent. In the beginning, I truly believed you when you said that your rage was my fault, that my actions caused you to lose control. I blamed myself, and tried to censor myself accordingly so as not to upset you. Then they became more frequent, but I chalked them up to financial strain. They did die down once we got some level of financial stability, when you were getting your surgery and I was preparing for the bar. We had so much fun planning our wedding, and I still think it‚Äôs the best bash anyone could have thrown. I continue to thank my parents for giving us our dream wedding. Then we had at least six more months before things started digressing into the same old toxic arguments that would last for days. I wanted to chalk it up to finances, but our finances weren‚Äôt nearly as bad as they had been, so I started thinking that maybe something else was going on. 

When I finally got the job I‚Äôve been working towards my entire life, and you got your settlement and the opportunity to do the things you had been talking about doing for your entire life, I began experiencing this odd feeling called ‚Äúconfidence.‚Äù Not just having confidence, but being confident. Our situation was finally improving, but our relationship continued to deteriorate. You attempted to exert a level of control over me I had yet to experience (which is saying something). But this time, I resisted. I finally had the strength and confidence to know that I was never as stupid as you accused me of being. I was never as much of a ‚Äúcunt-faced slut‚Äù you accused me of being. I could be successful and independent, and didn‚Äôt need a husband who throws around death-threats every time he sees his wife cry. I had to get out to protect myself. To reach my full potential. Nevertheless, I will persist. #MeToo #TimesUp #ThisIsMe2018

The girl who wears her sexuality on her sleeve because that is all she has ever known?

The girl who helped someone cheat when they told me they had left her to love me?

Who Would Want me?

The girl with mostly guy friends because only they got the sex jokes, the ones I said to cover my fears.
The girl who is overly confident but still afraid of letting people in because they will only leave in the end.

The girl who is not afraid to speak the truth about unwanted advances, touches and rape.

The girl who knows her heart cannot handle any more pain.

"2012, The year my gay friend showed his true self.",14,a8dtna,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a8dtna/2012_the_year_my_gay_friend_showed_his_true_self/,3,1545422618.0,"Hello,

My name is Andrew and this is my #MeToo story, I was going to make a throwaway account but i don't have nothing to hide.

&#x200B;

The year is 2012 and i'm spending a lot time with this guy, (i will not name, i would rather not face any legal action he could take, we will call him V) i have been openly Bisexual for a few months now and i'm enjoying life, i have known V for about 2 years at this point and before this night i'm not going to lie we had gotten close and started sleeping together every now and then, getting drunk and high not giving a rats arse about life.

So this night we had gone to the pub with his cousin and gotten drunk and after that we bought some drink from the off license to carry on the night, We just ended up walking around east London pissed off our heads, after we walk his cousin to her home we get a bus back to his house because i couldn't go home in this state, we chill for a bit and end up going to sleep in his bed.

So, at the time i couldn't sleep in the same bed as someone i just wouldn't sleep and if i did nod off i would be half asleep, i'm glad i was like this at the time, Anyway i genuinely thought something was going to happen that night but if i'm honest i really i wasn't in the mood, The night out was enough fun for me so i said good night and tried to sleep, V tries to kiss me i kiss back but then pull away because i'm tired.

It start here, V pulls his penis out and starts masturbating which i find extremely awkward, i turn over (stupidly) He tries to enter me dry, i flinch and turn back round, he stops for a while and its quiet,he must think i'm sleep because he proceeds to rip my boxers down and just performs oral sex on me, it felt like i couldn't move because i was in shock, My penis was flaccid but he carries on.

10 minutes later he stops, i couldn't believed what happened, this guy i thought i had feelings for just performed oral sex on me without my consent.

The next morning i don't mention it, He cooks me egg noodles, Tasted extremely dry, i go home after a shower.i text him about midday and asked him if he performed oral sex on me and straight up denied it and said i must have been dreaming, i feel angry.

As the years go by i forget about it and i never really saw him after that, He tried to invite me to camp outs but i don't trust him.

&#x200B;

Why did i leave this so long? because in modern society it is made out men cant be raped/sexually assaulted. i haven't taken action because i cant ruin someones life, if he had admitted it and said sorry maybe i could forgive him.

The transmission is out on my car, so one friend picked me up (3 hour drive each way) and another friend was supposed to drive me home. The friend who was supposed to drive me home asked if I would mind riding back home with someone she knew who was going in my direction. She assured me that she had known him for a long time and he was a good guy. 

I have a lot of stuff with me as well as my dog. About 45 minutes into the trip he shows me his loaded 9 mm gun.  I'm terrified of guns. About an hour later, he says that I should be happy he is bringing me home and how would I like to express my appreciation? He puts the center console up and tries to pull me across the seat. He attempts to put my hand on his crotch. 

I pulled back and let him know that he could stop and let me out. He didn't. He brought me all the way home and then asked if he could come in and ""be thanked.""

I gathered my stuff and my dog, got in the house and slammed and locked the door. 

I called my friend immediately to tell her what he had done and she said I must have misunderstood. He would never do something like that.

Not even home is safe,14,alklcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/alklcv/not_even_home_is_safe/,2,1548900859.0,"¬†I've struggled with mental health for as long as I can remember.¬† From the age of ~8 to 13 years old, I was sexually molested by my half brother. I was told things like, ""this is the only way you'll learn."" ""You don't want to seem like you don't know what you're doing when you have your first time. "" ""if you tell mom, our lives will fall apart."" ""I'll kill you if you say anything."" Just stuff that as a child coming into puberty and coming from an already emotionally chaotic household would think, ""you're right. I don't want to be a fuck up."" 
I knew it was wrong and I knew I shouldn't let him do things like that and that I needed to tell somebody but as a child the only thought I could produce was that I didn't want my family to fall apart which was already a fear that I had regardless of the assault I was facing. 
¬†I was 11 years old when I started self harming. I was 11 years old when I felt numb and dissociated from the life around me and had to do something to feel like I was a real human being. I was 11 years old when I started planning my suicide. And I was 11 years old when I cried myself to sleep the night I was going to do it when I imagined what it would be like when my mother finally found me hanging from the ceiling. I was a recluse child for obvious reasons so I would go days without leaving my room as is, when would my parents notice the smell of my dead body? I couldn't go through with it.
¬†I was 12 years old when I had my first boyfriend. We dry humped and almost had sex when we were left to our own devices. ""You want guys to like you"" echoed from my past. I was 12 years old when I finally told someone. It wasn't until I was 13 that I finally told my parents. They wept.
¬†I was 13 years old and given the choice between sending my brother to prison for 10+ years or keeping it a family secret. I was a child. I feared my family would fall apart. It stayed a family secret. The abuse stopped but it haunted me.
¬†I was 13 years old when I lost my virginity because despite the abuse stopping I was still brainwashed by it's effects. I want guys to like me. I want guys to like me. 
¬†I was 13 years old when my mom told me I need to go to therapy.¬† I refused.¬† They'll put me on medication. I'll be a zombie. 
¬†I never went to therapy. 
¬†I was 14 when I started starving myself. I would eat a slice of bread once in a while to deal with the hungry. 
¬†I was 14 years old and I was haunted by my brother forcing my 10 year old mouth into his penis.
¬†I was 16 when I was first cheated on. I was 16 years old and I could still vividly remember him coming into my room and dry humping me.
¬†I was 17 when I cheated for the first time. The trance of wanting guys to like me had worn off to an extent and had transformed into a twisted form of I wasn't attractive if men didn't want to have sex with me. I had sex with 10 different men in the course of 5 months.¬† That man and I never lasted. He was abusive and so was I. It was for the best.
¬†I was 17 years old and I was still cutting myself to wake up from disassociating from reality. I think of when I threatened my brother with a razor to keep him away from me at the age of 11. 
¬†I was 19 when my boyfriend¬† unknowingly saved my life. He took me on a late night car ride. Had showed up at my house and demanded we go for a drive. I was going to take a bottle of pills that night.¬† I never got around to it. I was given a reason to live.
¬†I was 19 years old when I found someone who had terrible experiences just as tragic as my own. I was 19 years old when it wasn't a family secret anymore. 
¬†I was 20 years old and withholding details of my assault because I felt like I let it happen to myself. Maybe I enjoyed it. Maybe it was actually my idea, my fault. 
I am 21 coming to terms that it was never my fault. I was a child taken advantage of and brainwashed. I am a survivor no matter what people think. My sign feels small but it still exists.

The Dixie cup and the freshman,14,abbbor,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/abbbor/the_dixie_cup_and_the_freshman/,8,1546290825.0,"


High school me didn‚Äôt really fit in with the crowd. Me- unapologetically 
awkward, different, smart but not street smart. I dressed differently, in vintage frocks with doc martens while most of the other girls at my new school in Arcadia, California were dressed head to toe in Abercrombie and Fitch. 
My mother encouraged me to be different and to stand in my truth. It seemed that most parents forgot what it was like to be a teenager, but not my mom. She was fully aware of the challenges that I‚Äôd be facing. 
And not in a you‚Äôd better not have sex before you‚Äôre married or hell and doomsday will be upon you but more in a- you‚Äôre going to want to experiment so please be safe kind of way. Because of this attitude of normalcy surrounding sex and my changing body, I didn‚Äôt feel it necessary to do anything with anyone until I was ready to. My virginity was something I was going to give when I met the right person. 


One day, my only friend in high school invited me to a party at cal tech, I was excited. I thought maybe I‚Äôd meet some interesting people. 
This is where my na√Øvet√© comes in. 
Newsflash- just because a party was being held at cal tech, the home of the smartest of the smart, it doesn‚Äôt  make it any safer. 
My friend was equally awkward but had a different outlook on sex. It seemed as though men and sex gave her fuel and made her feel worthy. An attitude that I just did not comprehend. Especially at the time. 

First mistake- I tell my divinely understanding mother that I am going to the movies and not to a college party not because I thought she‚Äôd say no but because I didn‚Äôt want her to worry. I didn‚Äôt plan to drink. I thought I‚Äôd be safe. I thought she‚Äôd never know. 
When we arrive at the party which is decorated like a tacky luau I make my second mistake- I accept the tiny Dixie cup filled with juice that I am told is non alcoholic. Getting drunk for the first time in the sea of strangers just wasn‚Äôt my bag. I take a sip and I was pleased.  It tasted tropical and alcohol free. Minutes later, my high school friend set her sights on a cute guy and left me there to mingle. Then, I start feeling odd. And very dizzy. I find the nearest wall. I catch it and I slide down unable to hold myself up. I remember thinking to myself, how can I be drunk if I didn‚Äôt drink any alcohol? I didn‚Äôt think about the possibility of anyone putting something in my drink. 
I couldn‚Äôt move, my head slumped to the side. My body felt like cement.  I could hear everything and I was aware but I was defenseless. The worst came when a group of guys realized that I was out. They started talking about me as if I wasn‚Äôt there. That‚Äôs the girl we‚Äôre going to fuck, one guy said. Let‚Äôs get her out of here said another. 
My friend was nowhere. I was alone and I was about to be gang raped. But then, a guy with a soft, kind voice sat next to me. He told me I was going to be ok. He told the guys to leave me alone. The guys heckled him and I remember this part clearly. They called him a stupid Mexican freshman. They made fun of him for not wanting to have sex. They called him gay.
They badgered him but he wouldn‚Äôt leave my side. He told me his name was Carlos. He told me Not to worry. He sat there with me fully willing to be an outcast. He stood up against sexual assault in an environment that was set up for sexual assault. 

No one laid a hand on me that night thanks to Carlos, the kind young man that I would never see again. Eventually, my friend found me and helped Carlos take me to her car. Remember, we were at the movies she says as she is mostly carrying me up the steps of my parents condo. My mom opens the door and I can only get out the words- I was at the moooooo.. and with that,  I vomit all over the carpet right there in the doorway. 
Obviously, not at the movies. Mom carried me in and nursed me back to health for nearly a week. Mom didn‚Äôt lecture me. She knew I had learned my lesson, and I really had. 

Years have passed and I still think of Carlos. I can‚Äôt even remember his face but I do remember his heart and his boldness.

It happened to #metoo,15,9tjxhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9tjxhe/it_happened_to_metoo/,8,1541164154.0,"I have told my story elsewhere on here and just wanted to come here to say I had a yucky sexual encounter during my time at college. I either got very drunk on two cans of beer or someone slipped something into my drink because even though I said no, it happened and I can't remember too much about it. I was covered in cuts and some bruises the next day.  I'm not sure what to call it, but it wasn't great experience. I went to the nurse to get plan B and cried but didn't discuss it with her other than I needed emergency contraception.

I also experienced a sexual assault by a man I didn't know, I blamed myself but I did see a counselor about this and it did help me to process the assault and my feelings a little.

&#x200B;

I have experienced lots of incidents of groping in bars, clubs, parties and men who I thought of as friends sending me photos of their junk and as an intern I experienced sexual harassment from an older man - who told colleagues that I slept with him (I did not).

"Just want to let this out, sorry for the long story",13,9s0ujx,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9s0ujx/just_want_to_let_this_out_sorry_for_the_long_story/,6,1540703076.0,"I made a throwaway account just to say this. Not sure if it'll be read but I needed to write this.

When I was 18 I went to a house party with some coworkers. I got really drunk but had 2 friends from work with me so I didn't get worried. But I ended up getting blackout drunk and passed out. When I woke up, throwing up, I could feel that my pants were pulled down and someone was fingering me. I tried to say stop but they just laughed and kept going. I kept on passing out and waking up, and I felt someone raping me. I got the sense that it was more than one person, and I could hear others laughing. Eventually I woke up to someone raping me while I was on my belly, face down. I got a big jolt when I felt it going in my ass and that caused me to scream and wake up for real and luckily they stopped soon after. I don't remember exactly how I got out, but I think my friends came back (apparently they had left to go pick up another friend) and helped me put my shoes on and drove me home. 

I eventually was told by someone who had been there that three guys had raped me, and they had done so after my friends (the only other females at the party) had left. A few of the others had watched, and someone took a video. My friends didn't even know what had happened until I told them. At first I was too embarrassed to tell anyone but my closest friend, but after three days I went to the police. 

The first thing they asked was ""are you sure you didn't just dream it up?"" I assured them that the pain in my ass was no dream. No physical evidence was gathered, as I had taken 2 showers since then and also it had been 3 days. For a time I had hope that I would get some justice for it, but that never happened. Even though some of the guys at the party told others what happened, and I had a text from a guy who told me of the existence of the video and who the three guys were, that wasn't enough. I did a call to one of them while at the police station. The detective thought he might admit to having sex since ""he seemed to like me."" But it just never amounted to anything. Everyone who they talked to who was at the party, including my 2 female friends, denied knowing anything of the sort had happened. Even though one of the female friends  knew exactly what happened, she pretended not to know because she didn't want to admit to underage drinking. 

This happened almost 6 years ago, and I have occasionally called the detective and inquired if anything more could be done. But she stopped picking up 2 years ago. To this day, I am haunted by that night. I could never seem to stop saying what if. What if I hadn't lied to my parents about going out? What if I hadn't drunk so much Bacardi? What if my friends hadn't left? What if I hadn't passed out? I try to explain to myself that rape is the fault of the rapist, and I truly 100% believe that, but it almost feels like that doesn't apply to me. Like it could have been avoided if I had made different decisions that night. Of course, it could have been avoided if the rapists had chosen not to rape, too, so why does it feel like I had a higher burden in preventing it then they had in not doing it? 

This really fucked me up. I'd always been a pessimist, but this just made me constantly angry. I carried around this intense rage all the time and was prone to snapping. The only thing that helped was the passing of time. Life kept moving on, even if I wasn't ready, and it sort of dragged me with it. I did see a trauma counselor for a few months, and I would feel better while I was talking about it with her, but it was only free for a certain amount of time. Once it ""expired"" I couldn't afford further treatment, and that kind of sucked. 

I told a few close friends about the rape and most of their responses were shit. ""Omg you have to be careful, you can't just be partying it up like that"" was one of them. My best friend was extremely supportive about it, and helped me get the courage to go to the cops, which was the right thing to do, even if it didn't get anything done. I avoided telling my two brothers for a few years because they're guys, and it's awkward, and I was worried about how they'd respond. I was right. One day I was arguing with my older brother while my family was all in the room, and he was saying some things that really made me explode, and I snapped, screaming at him ""I was raped you know"" to which he replied, ""I bet you were drunk"". Family is just great. I ran from the room and heard my mother telling him off, and I also heard him reply ""she's trying to manipulate me and it's not going to work""

These days I'm mostly ok. The fact that they got away with it still can make me so angry. I'll admit I often fantasized about getting my own vigilante justice, finding them and torturing them to death.  Even today I feel like I would give so much to be able to feel closure, knowing that at least one of them is paying for it. But I know that rationally it's impossible. So I have to just live with it. Most days I don't think of it, but when I do, it makes me want to hit someone. I hope that time will help dull it more until it no longer makes me feel so intensely.

I dont want to and when #metoo started years ago I posted some anonymous half story under a false name. I came out but only kind of. I am terrified. of what really I dont know. But here I go. 

I don‚Äôt mean that I am still around my abuser. It was only one incident when I was 8. But I have lived with the trauma for my whole life. I realize now that I have been continuing the abuse on myself for almost 30 years. It effects every decision I make, it is my most abusive self talk, it informs the kind of parent I am.  Anything can tigger my memory and all that follows. A kind of ptsd, if I hear a sound, a word, or even just driving quietly, my mind rests on this spot in my brain. And when anyone in my life unknowingly trips on my triggers I have acted out , lashed out rudely to unsuspecting people in my life. The worst of my triggers is that my abuser shares the name of a very famous and prolific author. I can‚Äôt walk through a book store with out a level of fear.  It happened to me one time and I have carried it.   

I remember in college another student was trying to help me and I remember saying  with real venom ‚Äú I am NOT stupid!‚Äù  He recoiled and we were never friends again. Because you see, I ultimately blame myself. I tell myself, ‚Äú you should have been smarter! You massive idiot! You knew it was wrong and you let him do it any way. You don‚Äôt deserve to live with such an idiotic brain! You are worthless and stupid!‚Äù  I am shaking as I write this because I tell myself these things everyday. It goes like a record endlessly over and over. And I‚Äôve had to go on with my life. It has altered my sexual behavior. I was taught how to continue to abuse myself since the incident and have been doing so for 30 years.  

My abusers name is Ken Follett. And he molested me and his daughter when I stayed at his house one night. 

When I hear kavanaugh comments and worst yet the words of our most unfortunate president,  demeaning women who come forward from their high place of privilege, I am utterly disgusted. 
No Mr. President, we don‚Äôt trumpet our trauma because the best abusers know how to make us blame ourselves. No, we don‚Äôt report our trauma because some of us were children and have spent decades trying to figure it out.  And No, there is no one to corroborate my story because the only other person who could is dead. 

Our leaders want to apologize to abusers because of what ‚Äú they have to go through‚Äù but I , we, have to carry this for 30 years and we have to get over it? 

To the leadership-
I have cried uncontrollably for days and still I have to meet deadlines. I have heard you question the validity of women‚Äôs stories and still have to meet the demands of my life.  What is your job? ",14,0,meToo,panread,1,2018-09-30 19:08:20

"This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry. The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein. Maureen Dowd (NY Times) Feb. 3, 2018",14,7v1ij5,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7v1ij5/this_is_why_uma_thurman_is_angry_the_actress_is/,9,1517686603.0,"Yes, Uma Thurman is mad.

She has been raped. She has been sexually assaulted. She has been mangled in hot steel. She has been betrayed and gaslighted by those she trusted.

And we‚Äôre not talking about her role as the blood-spattered bride in ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù We‚Äôre talking about a world that is just as cutthroat, amoral, vindictive and misogynistic as any Quentin Tarantino hellscape.

We‚Äôre talking about Hollywood, where even an avenging angel has a hard time getting respect, much less bloody satisfaction.

Playing foxy Mia Wallace in 1994‚Äôs ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù and ferocious Beatrix Kiddo in ‚ÄúKill Bill,‚Äù Volumes 1 (2003) and 2 (2004), Thurman was the lissome goddess in the creation myth of Harvey Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino. The Miramax troika was the ultimate in indie cool. A spellbound Tarantino often described his auteur-muse relationship with Thurman ‚Äî who helped him conceive the idea of the bloody bride ‚Äî as an Alfred Hitchcock-Ingrid Bergman legend. (With a foot fetish thrown in.) But beneath the glistening Oscar gold, there was a dark undercurrent that twisted the triangle.

‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù made Weinstein rich and respected, and Thurman says he introduced her to President Barack Obama at a fund-raiser as the reason he had his house.

‚ÄúThe complicated feeling I have about Harvey is how bad I feel about all the women that were attacked after I was,‚Äù she told me one recent night, looking anguished in her elegant apartment in River House on Manhattan‚Äôs East Side, as she vaped tobacco, sipped white wine and fed empty pizza boxes into the fireplace.
‚ÄúI am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did. Quentin used Harvey as the executive producer of ‚ÄòKill Bill,‚Äô a movie that symbolizes female empowerment. And all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do.‚Äù

Thurman stresses that Creative Artists Agency, her former agency, was connected to Weinstein‚Äôs predatory behavior. It has since issued a public apology. ‚ÄúI stand as both a person who was subjected to it and a person who was then also part of the cloud cover, so that‚Äôs a super weird split to have,‚Äù she says.

She talks mordantly about ‚Äúthe power from ‚ÄòPulp,‚Äô‚Äù and reminds me that it‚Äôs in the Library of Congress, part of the American narrative.

When asked about the scandal on the red carpet at the October premiere for her Broadway play, ‚ÄúThe Parisian Woman,‚Äù an intrigue about a glamorous woman in President Trump‚Äôs Washington written by ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù creator Beau Willimon, she looked steely and said she was waiting to feel less angry before she talked about it.

‚ÄúI used the word ‚Äòanger‚Äô but I was more worried about crying, to tell you the truth,‚Äù she says now. ‚ÄúI was not a groundbreaker on a story I knew to be true. So what you really saw was a person buying time.‚Äù

By Thanksgiving, Thurman had begun to unsheathe her Hattori Hanzo, Instagramming a screen shot of her ‚Äúroaring rampage of revenge‚Äù monologue and wishing everyone a happy holiday, ‚Äú(Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators ‚Äî I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs going slowly ‚Äî you don‚Äôt deserve a bullet) ‚Äî stay tuned.‚Äù
Stretching out her lanky frame on a brown velvet couch in front of the fire, Thurman tells her story, with occasional interruptions from her 5-year-old daughter with her ex, financier Arpad Busson. Luna is in her pj‚Äôs, munching on a raw cucumber. Her two older kids with Ethan Hawke, Maya, an actress, and Levon, a high school student, also drop by.

In interviews over the years, Thurman has offered a Zen outlook ‚Äî even when talking about her painful breakup from Hawke. (She had a brief first marriage to Gary Oldman.) Her hall features a large golden Buddha from her parents in Woodstock; her father, Robert Thurman, is a Buddhist professor of Indo-Tibetan studies at Columbia who thinks Uma is a reincarnated goddess.

But beneath that reserve and golden aura, she has learned to be a street fighter.

She says when she was 16, living in a studio apartment in Manhattan and starting her movie career, she went to a club one winter night and met an actor, nearly 20 years older, who coerced her afterward when they went to his Greenwich Village brownstone for a nightcap.

‚ÄúI was ultimately compliant,‚Äù she remembers. ‚ÄúI tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob. When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised. Something like that tunes the dial one way or another, right? You become more compliant or less compliant, and I think I became less compliant.‚Äù

Thurman got to know Weinstein and his first wife, Eve, in the afterglow of ‚ÄúPulp Fiction.‚Äù ‚ÄúI knew him pretty well before he attacked me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs. This was my champion. I was never any kind of studio darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me.‚Äù

Things soon went off-kilter in a meeting in his Paris hotel room. ‚ÄúIt went right over my head,‚Äù she says. They were arguing about a script when the bathrobe came out.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel threatened,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúI thought he was being super idiosyncratic, like this was your kooky, eccentric uncle.‚Äù
He told her to follow him down a hall ‚Äî there were always, she says, ‚Äúvestibules within corridors within chambers‚Äù ‚Äî so they could keep talking. ‚ÄúThen I followed him through a door and it was a steam room. And I was standing there in my full black leather outfit ‚Äî boots, pants, jacket. And it was so hot and I said, ‚ÄòThis is ridiculous, what are you doing?‚Äô And he was getting very flustered and mad and he jumped up and ran out.‚Äù

The first ‚Äúattack,‚Äù she says, came not long after in Weinstein‚Äôs suite at the Savoy Hotel in London. ‚ÄúIt was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn‚Äôt actually put his back into it and force me. You‚Äôre like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not his track.‚Äù

She was staying in Fulham with her friend, Ilona Herman, Robert De Niro‚Äôs longtime makeup artist, who later worked with Thurman on ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe next day to her house arrived a 26-inch-wide vulgar bunch of roses,‚Äù Thurman says. ‚ÄúThey were yellow. And I opened the note like it was a soiled diaper and it just said, ‚ÄòYou have great instincts.‚Äô‚Äù Then, she says, Weinstein‚Äôs assistants started calling again to talk about projects.

She thought she could confront him and clear it up, but she took Herman with her and asked Weinstein to meet her in the Savoy bar. The assistants had their own special choreography to lure actresses into the spider‚Äôs web and they pressured Thurman, putting Weinstein on the phone to again say it was a misunderstanding and ‚Äúwe have so many projects together.‚Äù Finally she agreed to go upstairs, while Herman waited on a settee outside the elevators.

Once the assistants vanished, Thurman says, she warned Weinstein, ‚ÄúIf you do what you did to me to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you.‚Äù Her memory of the incident abruptly stops there.

Through a representative, Weinstein, who is in therapy in Arizona, agreed that ‚Äúshe very well could have said this.‚Äù

Downstairs, Herman was getting nervous. ‚ÄúIt seemed to take forever,‚Äù the friend told me. Finally, the elevator doors opened and Thurman walked out. ‚ÄúShe was very disheveled and so upset and had this blank look,‚Äù Herman recalled. ‚ÄúHer eyes were crazy and she was totally out of control. I shoveled her into the taxi and we went home to my house. She was really shaking.‚Äù Herman said that when the actress was able to talk again, she revealed that Weinstein had threatened to derail her career.

Through a spokesperson, Weinstein denied ever threatening her prospects and said that he thought she was ‚Äúa brilliant actress.‚Äù He acknowledged her account of the episodes but said that up until the Paris steam room, they had had ‚Äúa flirtatious and fun working relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals in Paris,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúHe immediately apologized.‚Äù

Thurman says that, even though she was in the middle of a run of Miramax projects, she privately regarded Weinstein as an enemy after that. One top Hollywood executive who knew them both said the work relationship continued but that basically, ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt give him the time of day.‚Äù

Thurman says that she could tolerate the mogul in supervised environments and that she assumed she had ‚Äúaged out of the window of his assault range.‚Äù

She attended the party he had in SoHo in September for Tarantino‚Äôs engagement to Daniella Pick, an Israeli singer. In response to queries about Thurman‚Äôs revelations, Weinstein sent along six pictures of chummy photos of the two of them at premieres and parties over the years.

And that brings us to ‚Äúthe Quentin of it all,‚Äù as Thurman calls it. The animosity between Weinstein and Thurman infected her creative partnership with Tarantino.

Married to Hawke and with a baby daughter and a son on the way, Thurman went to the Cannes Film Festival in 2001. She says Tarantino noticed after a dinner that she was skittish around Weinstein, which was a problem, since they were all about to make ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù She says she reminded Tarantino that she had already told him about the Savoy incident, but ‚Äúhe probably dismissed it like ‚ÄòOh, poor Harvey, trying to get girls he can‚Äôt have,‚Äô whatever he told himself, who knows?‚Äù But she reminded him again and ‚Äúthe penny dropped for him. He confronted Harvey.‚Äù
Later, by the pool under the Cypress trees at the luxurious Hotel du Cap, Thurman recalls, Weinstein said he was hurt and surprised by her accusations. She then firmly reiterated what happened in London. ‚ÄúAt some point, his eyes changed and he went from aggressive to ashamed,‚Äù she says, and he offered her an apology with many of the sentiments he would trot out about 16 years later when the walls caved in.

‚ÄúI just walked away stunned, like ‚ÄòO.K., well there‚Äôs my half-assed apology,‚Äô‚Äù Thurman says.

Weinstein confirmed Friday that he apologized, an unusual admission from him, which spurred Thurman to wryly note, ‚ÄúHis therapy must be working.‚Äù

Since the revelations about Weinstein became public last fall, Thurman has been reliving her encounters with him ‚Äî and a gruesome episode on location for ‚ÄúKill Bill‚Äù in Mexico made her feel as blindsided as the bride and as determined to get her due, no matter how long it took.

With four days left, after nine months of shooting the sadistic saga, Thurman was asked to do something that made her draw the line.

In the famous scene where she‚Äôs driving the blue convertible to kill Bill ‚Äî the same one she put on Instagram on Thanksgiving ‚Äî she was asked to do the driving herself.

But she had been led to believe by a teamster, she says, that the car, which had been reconfigured from a stick shift to an automatic, might not be working that well.

She says she insisted that she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable operating the car and would prefer a stunt person to do it. Producers say they do not recall her objecting.

‚ÄúQuentin came in my trailer and didn‚Äôt like to hear no, like any director,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe was furious because I‚Äôd cost them a lot of time. But I was scared. He said: ‚ÄòI promise you the car is fine. It‚Äôs a straight piece of road.‚Äô‚Äù He persuaded her to do it, and instructed: ‚Äú ‚ÄòHit 40 miles per hour or your hair won‚Äôt blow the right way and I‚Äôll make you do it again.‚Äô But that was a deathbox that I was in. The seat wasn‚Äôt screwed down properly. It was a sand road and it was not a straight road.‚Äù (Tarantino did not respond to requests for comment.)

Thurman then shows me the footage that she says has taken her 15 years to get. ‚ÄúSolving my own Nancy Drew mystery,‚Äù she says.
It‚Äôs from the point of view of a camera mounted to the back of the Karmann Ghia. It‚Äôs frightening to watch Thurman wrestle with the car, as it drifts off the road and smashes into a palm tree, her contorted torso heaving helplessly until crew members appear in the frame to pull her out of the wreckage. Tarantino leans in and Thurman flashes a relieved smile when she realizes that she can briefly stand.
	
‚ÄúThe steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI felt this searing pain and thought, ‚ÄòOh my God, I‚Äôm never going to walk again,‚Äô‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn‚Äôt feel he had tried to kill me.‚Äù

Even though their marriage was spiraling apart, Hawke immediately left the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky to fly to his wife‚Äôs side.

‚ÄúI approached Quentin in very serious terms and told him that he had let Uma down as a director and as a friend,‚Äù he told me. He said he told Tarantino, ‚ÄúHey, man, she is a great actress, not a stunt driver, and you know that.‚Äù Hawke added that the director ‚Äúwas very upset with himself and asked for my forgiveness.‚Äù
Two weeks after the crash, after trying to see the car and footage of the incident, she had her lawyer send a letter to Miramax, summarizing the event and reserving the right to sue.

Miramax offered to show her the footage if she signed a document ‚Äúreleasing them of any consequences of my future pain and suffering,‚Äù she says. She didn‚Äôt.

Thurman says her mind meld with Tarantino was rattled. ‚ÄúWe were in a terrible fight for years,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúWe had to then go through promoting the movies. It was all very thin ice. We had a fateful fight at Soho House in New York in 2004 and we were shouting at each other because he wouldn‚Äôt let me see the footage and he told me that was what they had all decided.‚Äù

Now, so many years after the accident, inspired by the reckoning on violence against women, reliving her own ‚Äúdehumanization to the point of death‚Äù in Mexico, and furious that there have not been more legal repercussions against Weinstein, Thurman says she handed over the result of her own excavations to the police and ramped up the pressure to cajole the crash footage out of Tarantino.

‚ÄúQuentin finally atoned by giving it to me after 15 years, right?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúNot that it matters now, with my permanently damaged neck and my screwed-up knees.‚Äù

(Tarantino aficionados spy an echo of Thurman‚Äôs crash in his 2007 movie, ‚ÄúDeath Proof,‚Äù produced by Weinstein and starring Thurman‚Äôs stunt double, Zo√´ Bell. Young women, including a blond Rose McGowan, die in myriad ways, including by slamming into a windshield.)

As she sits by the fire on a second night when we talk until 3 a.m., tears begin to fall down her cheeks. She brushes them away.
‚ÄúWhen they turned on me after the accident,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool.‚Äù

Thurman says that in ‚ÄúKill Bill,‚Äù Tarantino had done the honors with some of the sadistic flourishes himself, spitting in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.

‚ÄúHarvey assaulted me but that didn‚Äôt kill me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhat really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?‚Äù She says she didn‚Äôt feel disempowered by any of it. Until the crash.
‚ÄúPersonally, it has taken me 47 years to stop calling people who are mean to you ‚Äòin love‚Äô with you. It took a long time because I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection and that is like the sort of era that we need to evolve out of.‚Äù",14,0,meToo,SixteenBeatsAOne,1,2018-02-03 22:36:43

Im filled with rage and sorrow and I don't think ill ever feel ok,12,b4ob5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b4ob5d/im_filled_with_rage_and_sorrow_and_i_dont_think/,5,1553375533.0,"I don't want to go into details because it's just too much for me so I do apologise that this might seem vague. 

I don't talk about it, I haven't told many people either but when I was 5-12 I was raped and molested by my dad. During this time, when we moved to be closer to his family, between the ages of 7-10 I was sexually abused by his brother (my uncle) too. Neither of them knew about the other. My parents found out about my uncle when I was 10 and we took him to court but they told me to lie and say that he had just shown me a pornographic magazine. They told me that I would get split up from my brother's if I didn't, so I lied and lost the case. 
Fast forward to 17 years old a few years after it stopped my mum approached me and asked me if my dad had done things to me. I said no at first but finally admitted it (apparently his sister had spoken to my mum and warned her ""what he was like"") honestly I wish she had said something years before. 
Her first reaction was ""I can't believe he cheated on me"" which made me genuinely want to hurt myself. Then she seperated with him, denied me counselling, convinced me not to press charges which I reluctantly agreed with (I don't know why, I was scared bad things would happen) and eventually after 8 months got back together with him. 
I felt massively betrayed and scared. I still hurt and I'm still inconsolably angry about everything. I'm 23 now and I have so many issues with people touching me or being near me. I also grew up with my dad constantly calling me a slut or a whore for having male friends which has done nothing but absolutely kill my self esteem. 
The thing is, my mum has been through a similar thing with her dad. Not only did she let him babysit me (he never did anything) she didn't notice any of the signs (wetting the bed into my teens, begging for her not to leave when I'd be left alone with him) I don't know if she was willfully ignoring it or genuinely didn't notice.

I've progressed a lot since, I'm seeing a psychologist now but still find it extremely difficult to say anything out loud. I've thrived, I'm somewhat successful and I genuinely don't blame myself. I do however still feel dirty and disgusting. I get a horrible feeling all over my body like my skin is crawling randomly at times, especially when people get close to me.
I wish I could erase my memory and forget everything. I want to feel normal and content but instead I feel like I'm always angry or desperately sad. ",12,0,meToo,octobees,1,2019-03-24 00:12:13
Disowned for Being Hurt,12,aggfem,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aggfem/disowned_for_being_hurt/,9,1547605538.0,"I was an elementary schooler when it started, my aunt bringing over her stripper friends who had kids to her house when the family had meetups. My cousin and I would play with their kids, but they weren't appropriate. My family found out of course, and became enraged with my aunt who was allowing this to happen. My aunt to take attention off of herself tried to make accusations against my father, which ripped the family apart even more. Of course there wasn't, she was just trying to ruin my parents marriage. It was just... An evil act. 

Not long after this, my mom started sending me (my dad wanted to protect me so it was against his protests) back to my aunt's (her sister), which resulted in many long years of trauma from... My cousin. Some of my earliest memories are being held down in the hallway in the middle of the night by her. It eventually progressed and became worse with time, lasting until some time in middle school. I didn't understand what was happening, and tried to ignore my PTSD attacks and nightmares and fear of sex for years. Eventually, I finally came forward, telling my dad about the abuse that occurred. My mom wouldn't believe me.

My mom's family began to be cruel, calling me a fat spoiled pig, or saying I should be aborted etc. Eventually out of anger I came forward about my sexual abuse after I was sexually assaulted by my college ex boyfriend. My mom's family disowned me, screaming at me and cussing me out telling me I should be in prison and calling me the f word and everything worse than evil that they could say to me. The worst was ""you always wanted to be [cousin's name], the best grand child-- you wish you had been molested by my sweet [cousin's name]! You p***y licking cock sucker!"" Said my grandma. 

Shortly after I started receiving texts from guys because someone had written my number on a bathroom stall saying ""send this slut your best cock shots"". I also found online bad reviews of me. 

I asked my aunt to stop or I was going to go public. She threatened a restraining order to try to shut me up.

Then, just today, someone signed me up for a weight loss program. 

So, here I am.

My family failed me. So here I am.

I am a victim of incest, and no one can silence me. ",12,0,meToo,LelouchUsagi,1,2019-01-16 05:25:38

I was sexually molested as a child by my uncle,14,a1m8bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a1m8bt/i_was_sexually_molested_as_a_child_by_my_uncle/,5,1543530816.0,"I dont remember when it started or ended, but I know that it lasted quite awhile. When I was a kid I was sexually molested by my families friend. In my families culture I was expected to call and look at this man like he was my uncle. So I called him my uncle and he even lived in the same house as my family for quite awhile. As I stated before I dont remember when this started but I do remember being quite young because this was before I even knew what sex even was. He lived in our basement and I remember that when my parents were gone or when everyone was upstairs he would call me down to the basement and I couldn't just ignore him because I was a child and an adult was calling me so I went downstairs. He wouldnt ask me to take off my clothes and he didnt take off any of his and this is why I wasn't able to admit to myself that it was what it clearly was for the longest time. Once I got downstairs he would be laying down wearing something like shorts or sweatpants and he would tell me to get on top of him, or sometimes he would tell me to lay down and he would get on top of me. He would than start pushing up against my private parts with his private parts and he would even whisper in my ear asking me if I was okay and I cant remember if I would say yes or not reply at all, but I remember as a kid that I would be laying there closing my eyes or looking straight ahead and the time seemed longer and longer. Once he was sure he could get away with it it became more and more often. He became more and more assertive. He would put his pants down my pants and would ask me if that felt good. I never said anything to my parents but I remember whenever my parents would leave my brother and I alone with him I would beg them not to leave not to go, but they would always go because they worked at night as well. When my brother would fall asleep he would tell me to come downstairs with him, because at this time my brother and I still shared a room. He would always caudal me, because he was always buying us toys or giving us money so I thought to myself as a kid that I had to satisfy him so that he would be nice to my brother and I. This went on for years even after he moved out of our house he would come to visit and when he came everyone was so excited even I was excited sometimes. But I remember when it stopped I even remember the exact pajamas I was wearing. I had to be at least 13 or maybe a bit older when I finally told him I didn't want to do this anymore, because at that time I knew what sex was and I knew that if I didn't stop it now I didn't know where this would end and I couldn't keep living with the shame. When I told him that I no longer wanted to do this he asked me why, he was offering me money, asking me if I needed anything, but I just kept saying no and before I left to go back upstairs he told me not to say anything. I remember once i got upstairs I took off everything I was wearing and went to take a shower. I just felt dirty, and for the longest time I blamed myself I said it was my fault. I always told myself that I didn't say no and I didnt try to stop him so it was my fault. I took this into my relationship life and I let men use my body for their pleasure no matter how uncomfortable I was no matter how many times I told them no eventually I would give up and let them do what they want with me. I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like. My parents are together, but not because of love, but because divorce isn't a thing in the african culture. I want to be in a healthy relationship, but Im not sure I know what that is. Im 20 years old and I am afraid to have any type of sexual relationship with anyone. I recently found God and through him I am able to realize my worth in this world and that my body is a temple and tha I deserve to be loved, but I find this situation always lerking in the back of my head.",14,0,meToo,anonnyjia,1,2018-11-30 01:33:36

I‚Äôm not proud of sharing this but I can‚Äôt keep it in forever,14,9rgyh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9rgyh2/im_not_proud_of_sharing_this_but_i_cant_keep_it/,5,1540522278.0,It‚Äôs been a long history so I guess I‚Äôll start at the beginning. When I was 18 I lost my virginity to some random stranger. It was ok until he forcibly pulled me into doggy style and had sex with me. I didn‚Äôt want it but I stayed silent and submitted. The second time I was having sex with my second bf at the time and randomly decided I wanted to stop. He kept going until he finished. The third time he got me high on weed and raped me. I wasn‚Äôt conscious enough for it to be consensual. I didn‚Äôt report either because I waited too long and I was ashamed. I was physically taller and bigger than this boy but I still got raped. How could it have happened to me of all people. Whenever I told people who‚Äôd listen they brought it up these points. What they don‚Äôt understand is although he was shorter and smaller he was much stronger than I am. Currently I‚Äôve had times with my bf where I‚Äôve wanted to stop but he guilted me into continuing or letting him finish. Whenever he‚Äôs done he‚Äôs always very apologetic and loving so I forgive him. I feel like I‚Äôm not a valid case because I am fat. It somehow seems to have less meaning because I am overweight. People probably think who‚Äôd rape that fatty? Idk I just try to not think about it.,14,0,meToo,emotional_loser,1,2018-10-26 05:51:18
Still in disbelief about what my mom said...,13,9q3ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9q3ban/still_in_disbelief_about_what_my_mom_said/,4,1540126789.0,"Recently I broke up with my boyfriend because I told him no before I went to bed and woke up with his hand in my pants shortly after I fell asleep. In a way it's my fault for it happening. 




I was having issues for months and was recently diagnosed with ovarian cysts. For anyone that hasn't experienced them, it's very painful during sex and not enjoyable at all. 



I'm a heavy sleeper so we tried waiting until I fell asleep and him relieving himself that way instead of doing it by himself. It worked, I just woke up sore but it was manageable. So I let him do it a few times. 




The other night we took acid... 




My trip was ending and I was about to go to sleep and he asked me if he could do it again and I said no because I was hurting really bad. I said no multiple times. 



I went to sleep and about 10 minutes after I laid down I woke up with his hand in my pants. After I had already told him not to touch me. I didn't freak out I just asked him why he did it and he didn't have an answer.



At first I kind of brushed it off like it was nothing and then I just felt hatred consume me. Why would he do that? Was it because of the acid? Had he ever done this before? How would I know because I'm a heavy sleeper? I broke up with him 2 days later, not just because of this. It was the cherry on top of a sundae made of self-harm, physical and mental abuse, and just let downs in general. 




Last night I went to a Halloween party at a mutual friends, and I haden't told anyone what he's done, no one we know needs to know what happened. We've broken up before and I should've known better, he was there. No matter how hard I tried to stay away from him he always somehow ended up next to me. I stayed long enough to be respectful to my friends and left. 



This morning I told my mom the truth about why we broke up and explained that I left the party early because I didn't want to be around him. She said ""That's just a boy thing."" 





I'm awestruck. I thought of all people she would understand the most but oh no... Boys will be boys.

#MYStory,14,7t1w9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7t1w9z/mystory/,0,1516937622.0,"Me Too! #MeToo  Black Clothing at awards ceremonies. I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot. I even posted ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù on my Facebook and Twitter feeds. But now I‚Äôm wondering, ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù What did me, and the thousands upon thousands of others, accomplish by saying ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù? I mean, ok, so now the world has officially been informed that all of us have experienced sexual assault, rape, molestation, and sexual harassment. I‚Äôve been told since 1988 when I started therapy to overcome my ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù that the statistics were dreadful. I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve seen or been told that 1 in 4 women will be sexually assaulted/abused before they die. This seems to have been common knowledge for decades now. Which brings me to ask, what does me and everyone else saying ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù change?
	
Now, along with ‚ÄúMe Too,‚Äù we have famous people stepping up and putting their specific faces and their specific stories beside those statistics. We also have people who aren‚Äôt famous, but their attackers were/are, so they have a platform to also put their faces and stories beside those statistics. And so hopefully this will make a difference in the venues of fame. Hopefully famous people and rich people won‚Äôt be able to continue to be predators in their industries and personal lives. Great! Wonderful! It‚Äôs about time! But‚Ä¶.
	
What do their stories and situations do for me and people like me? I‚Äôm not famous. My attackers aren‚Äôt famous. I don‚Äôt run in circles where famous people run. I have very little influence outside of a very small circle of friends and family. Again I ask, what does ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù really do for me and mine?
	
That is really what has been eating at me. It‚Äôs gotten me thinking about what I, and others like me, can do to change things in my social/economic level. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, & other social media networks create venues where the ‚Äúnot famous‚Äù can have a public voice. They provide us access to a much larger world than we would normally have and, even more importantly, they provides that world access to us. So, I have been thinking about telling my story - in all of it‚Äôs scared, depressing, sick, angry, screaming ugliness. But when I get to thinking that I will sit down and write the old shame rears it‚Äôs ugly head. That socially reinforced voice that has told me for my entire life that you don‚Äôt air dirty laundry to the public. That voice that says that all you will do is create hard feelings in the family. That voice that says why are you bringing this up now after all of these years? That voice that says no one will really care.
	
After weeks of arguing with myself and that voice, weeks of talking to others who have confirmed similar stories, and finally talking to my best friend, I‚Äôve decided not to listen to that voice any longer. I‚Äôm going to tell you about my ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù. I‚Äôm going to give details. I‚Äôm going to name the names I can remember. And if anyone gets upset with me for airing the dirty laundry, that‚Äôs on them, not me. They shouldn‚Äôt have dragged me through the mudhole.

Here goes nothing:

1976, Minot, North Dakota: My father was in the Air Force and he was stationed at Minot Air Force Base. The building we lived in was sort of like a townhouse unit. It was set up with two garages, four living units, then two garages again. Our unit was the first one after the garages and Keith‚Äôs was next. We were neighbors. I was 6. He was a few years older but I can‚Äôt remember quite how much. He seemed much older. I know that he was old enough that he babysat me and my 8 year old brother a couple of times.
 
The first time it happened we were walking home from school. There was a place where a large concrete drain pipe went under the sidewalk. He told me to go down there because he wanted to show me something. We climbed down and went inside the pipe and then he told me to lay down. I was confused but he said that I had to for him to show me. So I took my backpack off and laid down. He then knelt over me and pulled my pants down to my ankles and put his fingers inside me. It hurt and I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. I told him to stop but he didn‚Äôt. I tried to get up but he pushed me down and told me to be quiet. I started to cry and he stopped. I think he was afraid someone would hear me. He told me to get up and that if I told anyone I would get in trouble. I promised that I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone and pulled my pants up and hurried home. I felt sick to my stomach the rest of the day and was unable to sleep that night.

Keith acted like nothing had happened. I tried to keep my distance but he continued to be nice to me and would let me play with his Star Wars figures and other toys. My brother was not big on sharing so this was a big deal for me. Then one Saturday about a month later we were in his family‚Äôs garage (the inside wall of which was shared with my family‚Äôs unit). It had started out with Keith, his little brother, my brother and me. Then my brother left and shortly after his brother left. We kept playing for a little bit and then he got up and closed the garage door. He came over and told me to be quiet and to take my pants off again. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to but he said that if I didn‚Äôt he would tell on me for what happened before and that I would get in trouble. So I did what he said and laid back and shut my eyes. The next thing I knew his mouth was on my vagina. I was shocked and tried to sit up. He pushed me back down and did it again. He kept that up for about 5 minutes then I heard him unfasted his belt. My eyes were shut again so it was a real shock when I felt him enter me. As he began to move in and out I heard my mother outside the garage calling my name. It was suppertime and she was looking for me. Keith whispered to keep quiet. He said he would hurt me if I let her know we were in there, the whole time continuing to rape me. I laid there on that garage floor, tears leaking from my eyes, with him pounding into me, listening to my mother call for me just feet away. When it was over, he once again said that if I told anyone I would be the one to get in trouble. I hurriedly got out of the garage and went home where I then got in trouble for not being where I could hear my mom calling for me and for being late for supper.

From that point on my stomach began to hurt almost every day. Some days it hurt so much that I would throw up. Sometimes I would hide in my room and color or read. But, I would also play with my brother, Keith‚Äôs brother, and Keith too. I was 6 and I didn‚Äôt have many friends and they would play with me. He would play with me. He would also rape me 3 more times. Once in my own basement when he was babysitting. Each time he would remind me that I would be the one that would get in trouble if I told anyone. In 1977 Dad got transferred to Panama and we moved. I have no idea where Keith is today. I can‚Äôt remember his last name and I can‚Äôt remember his age. I remember being sick to my stomach all the time. I remember that he raped me while my mother was on the other side of the garage door calling my name.

1978, Howard Air Force Base, Panama: My stomach still hurt every day and it just kept getting worse and worse. Somewhere I must have overheard just enough to know that what Keith did to me made babies. I had no clue about periods, gestation lengths, or swollen bellies. I was 8 and I just knew I was pregnant. I lay in bed one night with my stomach rolling. I was so sick and getting worse by the minute. I determined that I must be about to have the baby and there was no help for it but that now I would have to tell my mom. I mean, I couldn‚Äôt have a baby by myself and I certainly couldn‚Äôt hide it. I went to my parent‚Äôs room where my mom was getting ready for bed and told her that I was having a baby. (My dad was not home that night, I can‚Äôt remember why.) She was confused and laughed a little and asked me what I was talking about. I told her about Keith raping me. 

I can‚Äôt really remember her reaction. I don‚Äôt know if she cried or got angry or anything. What I do remember is that she got out a couple of little booklets that explained the ‚Äúfacts of life‚Äù for girls. She had gotten them for when she was going to have ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù talk with me, but she certainly hadn‚Äôt expected to need them when I was 8. My first ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù outcry resulted in a very thorough sexual education discussion with my mother and me asking her not to tell my dad because I was still afraid that he would be mad at me and I would still get in trouble. She never told me that what Keith had done was illegal and wrong. She never told me that anyone doing things like that to me was wrong and that I could tell her and she would make them stop. My stomach still hurt.

Two months later I went downstairs after my shower to watch TV with my dad before going to bed. Mom was upstairs in her room reading and my brother was in the shower after me. I was wearing a long, tunic style robe, nightgown, and underwear. My dad had me sit on his lap while we watched TV. This was pretty much normal. I was sort of sitting on one of his legs leaning up against the arm of the chair with one of his arms around me and his other hand half on his other leg half on mine. 

Then that hand started moving slowly up and down my leg in small strokes. It kind of tickled but it kind of didn‚Äôt. I squirmed a little but didn‚Äôt say anything. Then it moved a little farther and he was touching my bare leg. Now it felt weird but I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just sat there. Then his hand started to lightly stroke up my leg under the robe and nightgown. I felt hot and cold at the same time. My stomach dropped. It felt like my skin was too tight and the air was pressing in all over me. My ears heard sound like I was under water. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. He kept moving his hand higher and higher, using that same super light, almost tickling touch. I couldn‚Äôt move, I couldn‚Äôt think, I could do anything but sit there frozen. Then his fingers were stroking me outside of my underwear and tracing the edges of the elastic. I felt trapped. I felt like I was going to die. I went numb. After a few moments of this he started to ease his fingers under the elastic and touched me. From somewhere outside of myself I saw myself look him in the eye and ask him, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you are doing?‚Äù He said ‚Äúshhhhh,‚Äù pulled his fingers back out of my underwear and continued to stroke me through the cotton. We sat like that with him molesting me until the show was over and he sent me to bed. I now know that my reaction, my being ‚Äúoutside of myself watching it all happen,‚Äù is called dissociation. I would spend quite a bit of the rest of my childhood/teen years dissociating/‚Äùdisappearing‚Äù.

I didn‚Äôt tell my mom about what my dad had done. I was confused. I honestly thought that she must have told him about Keith and he had decided that since I had experience with sex that it was ok for him to do it too. But I also knew that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to tell anyone. It was like this screaming, silent secret. For the next few years my dad would occasionally touch me, most often when he was tucking me in at night. He didn‚Äôt ever get quite to the point that he had on that first night but it was definitely within the definition of molestation. My stomach still hurt and I ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù anytime things got uncomfortable. Then we moved to New Jersey.

1982, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey: I was always that weird kid that didn‚Äôt really make friends easily and often times spent my days alone. This tendency increased as I got older. But, like most kids I craved attention. Good, Bad, Hurtful it didn‚Äôt matter because it was attention. Which meant attention from my father was, so I thought, a good thing. I would even seek him out because I knew he would give it to me. Even if I had to deal with him touching me it was worth it because I wasn‚Äôt alone. And yes, he was touching me. There was a man named Art living in the same building complex as us and him and Dad had become friends. There seemed to always be beer around and Art had an odd sense of humor. (Well, odd to an 12-year-old anyway.) He would make jokes that were very sexually motivated. He would use suggestive language and innuendo. I didn‚Äôt understand much of it but Dad laughed at the jokes and comments and on the days that Dad spent a lot of time around Art he would touch me a lot more. He would run his hand between my legs or massage my growing breasts. He would teasingly trace his fingers over my arms or neck like lovers do to titillate each other. 

I wouldn‚Äôt try to stop him. It felt good physically and it was attention. I knew it was wrong and that he wasn‚Äôt supposed to do it, but I didn‚Äôt stop him. Which made me think that I was a bad person. I mean I enjoyed the physical sensations his touching caused so of course it was my fault for letting him. It was my fault for hanging around him. It was my fault for ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù 

I did try stop him once when he sat me on the kitchen counter and wanted to open my jeans. I was pushing him away telling him ‚Äúno‚Äù when my brother walked around the corner and everything stopped. I‚Äôm not sure what would have happened otherwise because Dad was being very insistent. He had been with Art all morning in Art‚Äôs workshop with the door closed. God only knew what had been said or done but Dad was certainly in a mood that afternoon.

We moved a year later.

1986, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio: I‚Äôm 16. Dad has still been touching me off and on but it has slowed down to almost nothing now. It‚Äôs my brother‚Äôs graduation party and my grandmother, aunts, uncles, and a few cousins are there. I‚Äôm recovering from pleurisy and my chest and rib cage hurt. We discovered that a light massage helps ease the pain and mom has been rubbing my back and sides a little the past couple of days to help. I asked her if she could take a few minutes to rub my back to help with the pain and she said that she was busy and to ask Dad if he would do it. I went to him and he said he would. We went into the house into the dining room and he began rubbing my back normally then his hands began to ease around to my sides. The next thing I know his hands are creeping around and coming up under my breasts. I thanked him for helping and went to move away but he pulled me back against him and said that he would keep rubbing because he knew it helped. I could see the family in the back yard through the dining room window. I remember thinking how brash he was doing this out where anyone could look up and possibly see what was happening. A minute later Mom came back in the house and stuck her head around the corner to ask if Dad would light the grill and that was that. That was the last time my father molested me. 

Spring 1987, Piketon, Ohio: I had been a stewing volcano about Dad molesting me for a few months. I had told a friend of mine at school about it and one teacher who had been a sheriff‚Äôs deputy. He directed me to the school‚Äôs female counselor who, when I told her about the molestation, signed me out of school and took me to the courthouse to talk the sheriff. The sheriff, after hearing my story, told me that since it had been over a year since Dad had touched me and that since there was no actual rape, that it would be my word against Dad‚Äôs and it wasn‚Äôt worth pursuing. So there I was, a 17-year-old sexual abuse victim being told by the legal authorities that what happened to me didn‚Äôt matter and that I didn‚Äôt matter. I was devastated and outraged. I decided that if no one cared about me then I didn‚Äôt care either and I became angry at the world.

Dad had moved my Mom, bother and me to Piketon during the summer of 1986. Dad was still working at Wright Patterson but had moved us down to Piketon so that I didn‚Äôt have to change schools between my Jr. and Sr. year when he retired between them. He would only come to Piketon on the weekends. I began arguing with my Mom all the time. I literally hated my brother and couldn‚Äôt wait for him to move out. Then one night I was arguing rather harshly with my Mom. I can‚Äôt remember what it was about now but at some point the argument came around to why I never wanted to be at home when Dad was home. I remember I gave some sort of half-assed answer and she pushed and I finally just blew up and yelled at her about Dad molesting me and that I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with him. I angrily told her about me talking to people at school and being taken to the Sheriff who blew me off. I told her about him trying to touch me at my brother‚Äôs graduation party. 

She was shocked. She just sat there in stunned silence for a few minutes and then confessed that she had thought that she had seen something once or twice but that she just told herself that she was imagining things and it couldn‚Äôt have been what she thought she saw. She said that she was sorry that she didn‚Äôt try to actually find out and was going to say more but my brother barged into the room and began arguing with me that I was making it all up to get attention and to get my way. He bullied and pushed his opinion so hard that my mother began to doubt me (and herself again) and decided that she would go up to where Dad was staying and ask him about it. This happened on a Wednesday night. Thursday while I was at school, she and my brother went to Wright Patterson so she could talk to Dad about it and I got to have the house to myself overnight.

Friday night all three of them came home and the shouting started almost immediately. Dad had not denied that he had molested me but other than that I have no real idea of what they said to each other. He was enraged at me for going to the sheriff. I remember the words he yelled at me so clearly. ‚ÄúWhat sort of daughter goes to the police about her father?‚Äù To which my instant, screaming rebuttal was, ‚ÄúWhat sort of Father does that to his daughter? I hate you and I don‚Äôt ever want to be around you!‚Äù Then I stormed off to my room and made it a point to not be home when he was as much as possible. I have never spoken to my father about it again. I only spoke about it with my mother on two other occasions when we were discussing other aspects of our family dysfunction. It has remained the ‚ÄúFamily Secret‚Äù until now.

I have had years of individual therapy trying to deal with issues stemming from the actions of Keith and my Dad. I have shared my story in group therapy sessions. I even shared my story in a perpetrators/survivors mixed group encounter. (It‚Äôs odd that many of the men in that group were angry at my father and what he did to me but still weren‚Äôt able to equate themselves to him.) After all it though I still have issues stemming from the sexual abuse and rape. I have trust issues. I have intimacy issues. I have sexual issues. I still sometimes feel guilty. I feel guilt or shame for enjoying the physical sensations and for continuing to seek out the attention. Logically I know that my reactions and responses were normal and understandable and in no way made me complicit but emotionally sometimes it is hard to accept that. I still get angry. I don‚Äôt know if I will ever not get angry about it. Hearing others‚Äô stories brings up the anger. Hearing how other members of law enforcement or society turned a blind eye to the perpetrators behavior brings up the rage. And, sometimes, my stomach still hurts.

I‚Äôm tired of living in a society and a world where this keeps happening. Back in the 90‚Äôs in that mixed group we were told that sexual abuse was a chain sickness and that it was passed on generation to generation and that if we broke the chain that it would end. That if our generation just said no more that it would stop. Well, it‚Äôs 2018 and the chain looks to be as strong as ever. 

So I‚Äôm calling Bull Shit! I‚Äôm standing my ground and I‚Äôm telling MY story. I‚Äôm not rich. I‚Äôm not famous. The people who abused me aren‚Äôt rich or famous. But I was sexually abused and raped. My father is still out there living his life. I don‚Äôt know about Keith or Art. My story is just as important as all the actresses‚Äô and actors‚Äô. My story is just as important as the interns‚Äô and the politicians‚Äô. My story is just as important as anyone else‚Äôs. And so is yours! 

I encourage everyone who reads to share it. And I encourage everyone who has a story to speak up. Tell the world what happened to you in as much detail as you can handle. I understand the fear and the guilt and the shame. I understand the worries about how people will look at you or feel about you if they know. I understand being afraid of the anger from your families and friends and of course your abusers. But you deserve to be heard too. And if we keep putting our TRUTH in the faces of the people who want to sweep us under the rug, eventually they will have to see us and become afraid of OUR anger!

I know that sounds like a long stretch...... but aside from when I was raped every time would of been a result of her actions...



-First time was at my grandparents my step grandpa was a fucking creep, no one in the family believes me even now, but when I was little my mom left us at my grandparents a lot as kids.... papaw as we called him would always ignore all the kids but me and ask me to climb on his back or lap constantly or ask me to fix his hair or just rub his scalp for him....... he always requested kisses on the lips when I left no one else had to...... he would play cards a lot poker specifically... 


He called me ‚Äúhis good luck charm‚Äù would grab me from any room even when asleep and put me on his lap to play poker with me there as his charm...... I told my parents I didn‚Äôt like this cause papaw always had a toothbrush or stick in his pocket and it hurt to sit on.... they continued to make me go there till I was 15 he even tried to help me potty and change and bathe numerous times none of the other 25 grandkids got that treatment. 

-Second time I was told my uncle was moving into live with us, he would sleep on a air mattress in the computer room till he found a place (20 years later dude still lives with my parents) he would baby sit us for my parents if they had to do stuff .... his baby sitting was turn on tv and jerk off in computer room to little Asian girls ...... anyways one day I walked in on him it was a kid like me in the screen with her mouth open.. he saw me continued to pull on himself and asked what I wanted I said I needed lunch but no anymore and ran, I was scared of my room next to his so I asked to sleep on the couch outside my parents room..... till one night I woke up to someone touching my breasts and moaning... he was jerking off over me.... then noticed me awake and pretended to be sleep walking .... told my mom she said I was lying and to stop being gross...... 


-third time I stayed with an aunt and uncle (preacher uncle) in another state cause my mom was upset with me bout beginning my teen angst years..... while trying to sleep the uncle came in my room and tried to sleep big spoon little spoon with me with a full erection I cried and ran to my aunt and she slept in a room with me said uncle was drunk...... (month later uncle got caught soliciting sex from a minor that was a cop undercover)


-fourth time I needed a ride home from a school play cause I didn‚Äôt drive my mom and dad wanted to leave and go to bed but a cast party was happening after I wanted to go to... so she asked my guy friend of mine I didn‚Äôt know very well but that had a car to take me home after the party....... he agreed.... he was younger then me by two years ..... after the party I get in his car he helps me buckle and I thank him we get close to my house and he starts trying to rip open my shirt and fondle my breasts says he won‚Äôt take me home till I let him suck in my breasts...... I developed a 40H breast by age 15 so this obviously was something I heard a lot so I laughed and pushed him away he threw me out the moving car in front of my house by undoing my belt when I wasn‚Äôt looking and shoving me out the door he opened while leaning over me..... his dad was a cop so he didn‚Äôt get anything for me reporting it ...... he has a YouTube channel now that is pretty successful that I occasionally comment on the videos of about him being a monster....

"Why I stopped watching Naruto and why I can never go home. (Trigger warning, TL;DR at end)",12,b0mq8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b0mq8u/why_i_stopped_watching_naruto_and_why_i_can_never/,10,1552487867.0,"Seems like a really weird title, but this will be a summary of my overall childhood-teenage trauma.

My mom seriously hooked up with this guy... We'll call him JJ, when I was in elementary. He seemed like a decent guy, but my mom was young, irresponsible, and hypersexual. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment. Instead of waiting for when I was at my grandfather's, They would have sex while I was in the room. She never thought it wrong to watch shows/movies that had sex in them in front of me because I was ""mature for my age"". She had a lot of mental demons, and was on drugs as well.

To give him credit, he did try to do the responsible parent thing. It lasted until puberty hit. He claimed that my periods were some form of sexual trigger for him because he was sexually abused by his older sister. Don't know if it was true but it's no excuse. He told me he could always smell the blood.

As puberty goes, personal hygiene has more requirements and my mom noticed I wasn't taking care of it. She gave me a book on it, but hell I didn't read it. So in her mind, it made perfect sense to have JJ teach me female body things because she felt too ""lesbionic"" (her actual wording) to do it. So he taught me how to shave my privates. And this is where it goes downhill. Some areas were harder, so he decides to do it himself to help me. Apparently I was getting naturally stimulated from him touching me and he noticed this every time he helped me shave. Keep in mind I was about 12-13 at this point. He decided it would be a great idea to just go ahead and make me orgasm to ""stop"" the arousal. He puts Naruto in the background to help keep me distracted. He starts to touch me. In my head I just shut down. I didn't want it, but I didn't know what to do. JJ tells me to grope myself to help the process. I listen, but eventually he realizes I'm clearly not into it and stops. I couldn't watch the show after that because it would cause me to relive that moment.

The rest of my preteen/teenage years was just a straight up Stockholm syndrome. He was the only one emotionally there for me, who acted like a parent. My mother was so overworked at the time, I felt like my existence was just an inconvenience to her. JJ took care of school stuff, would drive me to events, make sure I did my homework, listen to my friend drama, etc. But then he'd sneak into my room at night when he thought I was asleep and touch me.  He was an alcoholic as well, so this happened frequently on nights he would drink.

I remember one night he got drunk and was crying, saying he wanted to kill himself for what he did to me. To this day I wish he did. 

He would get jealous of my boyfriends and make extremely inappropriate comments about my female friends. It got to the point he was so brazen that in my senior year he asked me to have sex with him so he could know ""what it felt like"". 

It got worse when I had sex for the first time. For context, I promised my mom I wouldn't have sex until after I graduated high school. She was worried about me getting pregnant because she was a teenage mom and her parents and step-parents are toxic assholes at times. So her fear from her abuse led to me basically not having a social life. When JJ started to express serious sexual interest in me, I was genuinely afraid he would get drunk and impatient one night and then proceed to rape me. An opportunity came when I was 18, and so my best friend and I had sex. We weren't dating, but he was the love of my life and I knew I wouldn't regret it. Still don't. JJ could smell the blood and knew it wasn't my period. He asked what I did that day. He commented on the blood so I admitted what I did. He got extremely drunk that night. Late at night he came into my room angry and crying saying things like ""He didn't deserve that! I would have honored you"" and some other possessive bullshit. He started treated me with more hostility after that, but still asked me to consider having sex with him.

High school ended, and my grandparents from down south (the others lived in the same town we did) said why don't I take a vacation before I started college. I graduated cum laude, and had a lot of scholarships. Despite some bad blood my mom agreed and I was to stay for 2 weeks. She and JJ said when i get back we can go job hunting and such. My grandparents down there insisted I considered looking at the colleges where they lived and that they would help me. I didn't take it seriously because I had gotten a full ride scholarship at my local community college. Then the phone call came.

My mother was terribly sick and hospitalized. JJ wanted me to come back home to take care of the house and the dogs so HE could stay with her at hospital. I was confused because I should be the one at her bedside.  One night, my grandfather from home called. We talked about it all and I could tell he was livid at JJ. He then asked the question. He had a bad feeling for quite awhile, but he couldn't ask my mom because she practically knew nothing about my personal life. He didn't know how to properly ask me before because I was a kid. He cried on the phone with me and begged me, BEGGED that I don't return home because otherwise I would be trapped there. I listened. The last time I even faintly remember him cry was when his mother passed away. I texted JJ and told him I wasn't coming back. My mother grew angry and almost disowned me because of it. She didn't understand why I abandoned her in her time of need, while JJ was trying to slut shame me in front of my grandfather. We didn't talk for months, and I was okay with it.

Once I was psychologically aware I was free of JJ and his manipulation, I told my friends and family what happened. Unfortunately we did not go to the police because of my mom. But he suffered. He couldn't find a job because my friends worked at half the places he could apply (he has a criminal record).  Even strangers began to know him as a sex offender. He had to go out of town to try and find a job, and blamed me for lying about him to everyone. My grandfather told him he was no longer allowed on his property. My mom didn't understand why. I don't know if she didn't believe me or what, but she stayed with him. When they were on the verge of breaking up, I begged her to come find an apartment with me and just leave him. But she didn't/couldn't. About a year later, she was pregnant with my sister. She was keeping the baby and staying with him. I was heartbroken and disgusted.  My sister is in elementary now, but I hate having to pretend like nothing happened with my mom. JJ knows I refuse to talk to him, he's tried messaging me on social media on more than one occasion. But now it's not just about him and me. Now she's in the picture.

For now, I think she's fine. But I'm worried about when she hits puberty. Will she be safe because she's actually his child? Will he psychologically restrain her from a healthy social life like he did me. The only thing that will make me feel better is if he is 6ft under. 

Many times he's tried to convince me that it was all in my head because I'm mentally ill. I still have nightmares involving him to this day. While some of the details are fuzzy, 7 years of abuse cannot be my ""imagination"".

TL;DR: Mom created the environment for her bf to abuse me from middle school to high school. He used my favorite show to try and make his actions seem less..... Wrong. She didn't listen to anyone about my sexual abuse, and had a kid with my abuser. They're a happy little family while I still have nightmares about what he put me through.",12,0,meToo,inksolblind,1,2019-03-13 17:37:47
A pool and festival incidents,13,ar34s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/ar34s6/a_pool_and_festival_incidents/,0,1550276064.0,"So I actually have two incidents that happened to me, personally, and wish to let it off my chest.

The first happened when I was 14.
My friends and I went to a pool in our town over the summer. One of my friends, let's call her Jane, and I decided to stay in the pool a bit longer while the rest scattered around cause the sun was getting higher  sunburns, famine, thirst etc.
There was like a 'whirpool' in the center of the pool and if you got hit by one of the jets it'd send you flying through the water (well not literally but it was fun).
So, since we're all reasonable human beings and tried to find shade during the hottest period of time of course the pool was full including the little whirpool area.
That made it unbelievably easy to grab someone's glasses of their head and steal them (that happenes a lot) and grab someone's butt whithout them noticing you.

The second part happened to me... not once, not twice, but three times. Each time I turned around to see who it was and by the third time I was fairly positive who it may have been. Before the third time I had told Jane about it and she said the same thing happened to her.
So now it wasn't only me, and I am very protective of my friends, so the third time it happened I turned around looked the guy dead in the eye as he grinned and splashed him with water.

He knew he was guilty, he knew why I did that, but still he felt as if I had to be punished, for splashing him in the face.
He grabs me and shoves my head under the water. Had Jane not been there I would have drowned. I'm an agile swimmer and she's been training swimming but nothing prepares you for someone trying to intentionally drown you.

Every time I got out I screamed but no one around us bats one eye in my direction (keep in mind the pool is full and the life guards are next to the fucking whirpool thing). I kept trying to get the lifeguards to notice me by screaming but they didn't even flinch.
At one point he's holding me under water and I guess Jane did something to him so he goes under and I strike him with my free leg (he had a thight grip over the other one). I hit him straight in the head which angers him even more and he flings me around so I end up hitting my head pretty hard against the wall in the water... but that was when he finally lets go. 
We swim out and I spend the rest of the day just running from him.
I haven't been to a pool since.

The second incident happened when I was 18 and we were at a music festival, still in my town.
I went with my girl friends from high school and after jamming to music for about 3 hours with pauses we decide to go and grab a bit to eat at one of the overpriced food stands. 
After grabbing the food we sit on the ground and a guy that was passing by, comes back and crouches to us. 

He was obviously drunk as hell and we wanted to do nothing with him, and asked him to leave nicely a copule of times. He ignores us ofc, and proceeds to talk how mighty in bed he is. At that point I snap and ask him well what if we're gay, will you leave us then?
He looks me in the eye and says: ""Obviously you haven't had a dick to know what's good.""
Pushing my nerves to the edge I reply with: ""Actually I tried both, and I'm preferring vaginas over non existant penises like yours"".

Sees there's no point in talking to me anymore he turns to my friend, Anna, who was on the edge with him already and starts tapping her on her knees.
She warns him to stop touching her or she'll throw the empy beer can at him.
He then leaves and we all let out a sigh of relief only for him to be back in less than a minute.
We grunt begging him to leave again, Anna saying the same threat again.
He turns to her, for some reason pissed off starts touching her legs, an que her point blank swinging the empty beer can at him and running off to find security. 
He leaves and we're all on the ground thinking thank god he left, but then I realise that Anna left and he went in the same direction so I get the others up to go looking for her.
Thankfully she was already with the guards so we as well explained what happened and moved along back to our jamming spot.

Back there there were girls handing out some hats of some sort idk they were doing a promo for a drink.
I got one but the guys behind us that came later didn't.  So one of them taps me on the shoulder and asks where I got the hat from. I kindly explain to him where and turn back to my friends.

A few minutes later another tap, same guy. Tells me his friend would like to 'meet me/hook up with me'.
I say no. He then asks why and I'm already agitated so I just tell him that 'I'm gay'. No offense to gay people, it's just the easiest way of getting rid of a guy that doesn't take a no for an answer.
Few minutes later I feel a but slap.
I turn around a stare daggers to the guy that was tapping me on the shoulder. He was grinning, said something in between the lines 'twas an accident' and then just left...

That happened last year, and I regret not slapping him back on the face. I was just stunned out of my mind and didn't know how to react... ",13,0,meToo,ElenaG99,1,2019-02-16 03:14:24

Women used to hit on me (and other stuff) when I was far too young.,12,a2st47,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a2st47/women_used_to_hit_on_me_and_other_stuff_when_i/,7,1543870057.0,"I believe I was very naive growing up.  Apparently, though, that naivet√© meant girls and women could do things to me and I didn't realize it was inappropriate.  I mean, I should have known it was wrong because I didn't share that information with others.

There was a woman who told my dad she wanted to screw me, a LOT. I was fifteen, she was over forty.  She had friends who would basically flirt with me in my bedroom, but I always felt weird about it.
There was a time this older woman pretended to be scared of the dark so she could feel me up.
Recently, I found out that one of my dad's girlfriends' daughters made my baby brother finger her (she was 15, he was 9)

Married women used to touch me and kiss me and I kept losing friends because I couldn't be around their wives and older sisters (and moms). 

I've been made to feel bad about this my whole life, but I tell my children (2 boys and a girl) that nobody is allowed to touch them or make them feel uncomfortable and they need to tell me and their mom if anyone ever does.

I'm in my mid thirties, married to the same woman for a decade, and I don't share any of this with her, or our kids.  I know I could, without judgment.  But I just can't.

Why can't I accept that what happened to me wasn't because of me?  What's blocking me from using my experiences to help others, especially my own family?

Anyway, thanks for reading. And if you didn't:

The first time it happened I was about five years old... this is my whole story.,11,9ponb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9ponb4/the_first_time_it_happened_i_was_about_five_years/,2,1539988007.0,"I remember as if it  happened yesterday. We were all in my Dads bedroom (my older male cousin, my older brother, my older female cousin, my younger brother, and maybe a few other kids) playing video games while the adults made dinner/talked about adult things. My older male cousin (who was a teenager well into puberty) told me that we were going to play a game. He grabbed the blanket off of the bed and put his arms out to hold the blanket like wings and he plopped down with the blanket over both of us (like a tent). He pulled his pants down, just enough for it to stick out. He told me to put it in my mouth like a sucker. And I did. Some time later, someone opened the bedroom door  to tell us that dinner was ready so he ripped his pants up and uncovered us both.

That night my cousins spent the night so all of the kids slept on a big pallet in the living room floor. He made sure to sleep next to me. He woke me up sometime in the late night/early morning. He told me we were going to play again. He did the same thing with the blanket. He had me pull my panties down to my knees. He proceeded to touch me (I think that was all he did but I cannot really remember). I didn‚Äôt know what it was that we were doing, but it felt good, but it also felt bad at the same time. I knew that we were doing something secret and bad but I felt like I was the one who was gross for liking the way my body felt. I fell asleep with my panties at my knees. 

When I was little I would often wake up with my butt up in the air (I just slept that way I guess). The next morning, I don‚Äôt remember who came in first but I woke up to one of the adults voices and I realized that my panties were down and my butt was in the air. The blanket was not covering me. Whoever it was that woke me up, fixed my panties, covered me up with the blanket, and brushed it off as something silly that happened in my sleep. They weren‚Äôt suspicious whatsoever (as far as I could tell). I don‚Äôt know if this was the only incident, but it is the one that has haunted my memory.

I started masturbating at five years old. I wanted to stay away from my cousin but I wanted to experience whatever it was that happened down there. I would make my Barbies hump each other. When the question of ‚Äúwhere do babies come from‚Äù came up, someone asked how I thought they were made and I responded ‚Äúthe daddy pees in the mommies mouth and she gets pregnant‚Äù. No one noticed anything was off, no one was suspicious, no one asked any questions. 

A year or so later, my dad took on some foster kids: a girl and two boys (they were our second cousins or something). Some time after they started living with us, the girl accused my Uncle of touching her (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true but she did come from a rough home). She convinced me to lie and say he touched me too (he never did). My parents, parents of the cousin who had been touching me, and our grandparents called us both into the living room. I remember them all sitting in a big semicircle. They asked a question I was ready for ‚ÄúHas uncle X ever touched your tutu‚Äù (aka genitals). She said yes, they all looked at me, I reluctantly said yes. The asked another question, this time I was not prepared ‚Äúhas anyone else ever touched you‚Äù. I was silent for a while, and then I said yes. They asked who it was and what they did. I gave them my cousins name and said ‚Äúhe just put his hand down there‚Äù. They continued with ‚ÄúWhen? Where were you‚Äù I told them that I was in my bed and that he came in when I was asleep and touched me. His parents immediately accused me of lying and called my cousin into the living room. They asked him if it was true, and of course he denied it. They believed him. I was deemed ‚Äúa little liar‚Äù, and they never touched the subject again. At age 8 we moved four hours away (lower Alabama), and I thought my troubles were over.

Fast forward to age 19, I was visiting home (lower Alabama) from college for Labor Day because school was out. I spent the night with a friend I made working at a water park during the summer. This friend was a few years older and she was married with a kid. I was previously a bridesmaid in her wedding and we had been friends for a few years. They didn‚Äôt have a guest room so I slept on the couch in the living room. I felt completely safe. I was woken up to a tingling sensation on the front of my pants. When I shifted my body to try to get it to stop, I heard footsteps running away from me and the sound of a door opening and closing. I was frozen in fear. I laid there silent and solid for what felt like hours. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I didn‚Äôt have a car, I didn‚Äôt know what time it was so I didn‚Äôt know if I could call anyone.  I couldn‚Äôt go outside because, what if that‚Äôs where he was?

As I noticed the darkness outside becoming dimly lit. I finally built up the courage to quickly grab my purse and run outside. I ran. I ran down the street. I ran away. I don‚Äôt know how long or how far but I ran until I didn‚Äôt know where I was. I was scrambling to figure out what to do when I remembered something my dad told me. He showed me how to pin my location using the GPS on my phone. He told me that if I ever needed him for any reason to take a screenshot of my location and send it to him, no questions asked. I pulled out my phone and sent him my location. I called him and told him I needed him to get me. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way‚Äù. 

My dad got there way faster than it should have taken him to get there at safe speeds. The car ride home was silent, tears slowly rolled down my cheeks. When we got home, we went inside and sat on the couch. He asked if I wanted to talk about it. I told him what happened. He called the police and we filed a report. I took a shower until it ran cold. My friends husband was arrested. We went to court one time. The district attorney asked if I had ever given my friends husband reason to think I liked him. The DA asked if I ever flirted with him or even sat too close to him. I told him no and that I was even in their wedding. He told me that because I was 19 that there wasn‚Äôt much of a case. My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was by her husbands side the whole time. She stood by him while he told the judge that I flirted with him and that it wasn‚Äôt his fault. They eventually found out that he was an illegal immigrant and he disappeared. I don‚Äôt know if he was ever charged for sexual assault. My ex friend eventually left her husband. 

At age 24, my older brother (26) revealed to me that the same cousin who molested me also molested him. Months later I told my story to my dad for the second time. This time he believed me. I still have issues because of these two events. They will stick with me for the rest of my life, in vivid detail. I say in the title that this is my whole story. Statistically, it is likely to happen again.  PLEASE listen to your children, even if their story sounds preposterous. Encourage them to share anything with you. Do what my dad did and tell them that you will be there for them no matter what with no judgement and no questions.",11,0,meToo,alyssaleenicole,1,2018-10-20 01:26:47

I'll  read letters of those who consider themselves survivors and how they are somehow stronger because of it. 

No we didn't get bit by a spider and suddenly we have web slinging, sense tingling Spiderman /or spider woman abilities. 

Reoccurring trauma creeps back into our lives unknowingly at the worst of times. We don't get superpowers. 
We know exactly how vulnerable and scary that moment was and that yes we were victims. 

For many of us, telling people we are survivors is just the same as telling people a fairytale. That at the end of the story we won. That we triumph and have complete control over our lives now. 

That we are living life to the fullest and we got our revenge. 

The truth is..... We got far from it. 


We are stuck with anxiety, ptsd, depression and a boat load of other problems that don't have quick fixes overnight. 

The problem for me is...... Overnight is the worst time for me. When I close my eyes. I don't know what world is coming next. I don't know how long it will last and all my fears come back. 

I get severe sleep paralysis. When combined with the sexual and domestic abuse I experienced from my brothers. It's like it's happening all over again. Every week, and I don't know when it will strike. What I do know is that it only happens when I sleep. 

So fuck that, I'm a survivor bullshit. I feel like I'm still being victimized and punished during times I go to sleep. 

My body can't move, I feel like I'm being held down. I know that I have to fight to wake up and suddly I start having nightmares that I'm trapped in the room with one of my brothers and he's tormenting and molesting me. Holding me down and trying to force his tongue into my mouth. It's so discusting. 

I can't call myself a survivor. I still feel like it's happening. 

TBH, when I see someone write that I see a reflection of myself. I see the part of me for the last 10 or so years trying to bury and dismiss what has happened to me and assume I had to become a stronger person because of it. 


I know I wasn't his only victim. I know that there are other victims. I know that people will defend him and say that I am a liar. Those people are my family members. Those people are his family members. He will convince them all that I am an awful person and that I am going to destroy his life if I ever tell the truth. 

I am not at all a survivor. I am a victim, before only physically, but now also mentally and socially. 

I get anxiety talking to my family members. I moved 2000 miles away just to try to make myself feel better. When SP happens and I relive all the moments again. It feels like I never survived my abusers.

My Me Too Story,11,9kj2lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9kj2lx/my_me_too_story/,1,1538419337.0,"  

I‚Äôve held out on writing my story because I‚Äôve never spoken these words. I didn‚Äôt know how to speak them. My story feels so huge and dark and deep and horrifying, to me. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs how the millions of men and women felt that have had these experiences as well. 

When I was 15 years old I was put into a treatment center for kids called Straight Inc., It was for children that were labeled as drug addicted or had criminal behavior. It was during a time when treatment centers were extremely popular. If you had an issue with your kid, any issue, just throw them in a rehab. I‚Äôd had some issues but I was not a drug addict or a criminal. This treatment center was different than a rehab. It was a treatment center for kids and ran by kids using a method they called ‚Äúpositive peer pressure‚Äù. Most of us were lied to just to get us through the door. I was told that we were going to a doctor‚Äôs appointment and then shopping at the Galleria in Dallas. I was lead down a dark hall to a small office where two kids my age were sitting, they closed the door. I was terrified. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to speak to my mother or anyone in my family for another 6 months and I was held against my will for two years. 

Straight Inc. was a program that was endorsed and supported by our political leaders that at the time our parents trusted most. George Bush Sr., Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and even Princess Diana, spoke publically about this program which was heavily advertised through the news media and our public schools. How could it be bad?

The terror I felt and horror I endured for the next two years of my young life left deep scars that will never go away. 

‚ÄúThe REAL Straight, Inc. was a facility that used coercive thought reform (aka mind control, brainwashing), public humiliation, sleep and food deprivation, extremely harsh confrontational tactics, kidnapping, isolation, and emotional, mental, psychological, verbal, and physical abuse to forcibly break us down and then remold us in the Straight Inc. image. Straight, Inc. also operated in secrecy, just like a cult. No outsiders were ever permitted to know what really went on inside. Straight‚Äôs rules and our fear of harsh punishment prevented us from talking to outsiders or from reporting abuses.‚Äù I‚Äôve used this quote from a Straight Inc. Survivors website (of which there are many) because these words are better than my own when describing this place. 

On most days there were no qualified adults present. We were a group of children, led by children that had either gone through the program or were still in it but on a ‚Äúhigher phase‚Äù.  The tactics listed in the above paragraph were among the ones that were ‚Äúallowed‚Äù. Can you imagine what can happen when hundreds of broken/abused kids are given those types of guidelines with no supervision and are kept together in one room for 15 hours a day for ‚Äògroup rap sessions‚Äù? 

The building‚Ä¶ The building we were in was a warehouse in the Warehouse District in Richardson, Tx. There was a huge open room where we spent most of our days as a group. Sometimes they would split us up and take us into one of the many back offices. Sometimes I would be picked out of the group and be taken into the back alone. I wasn‚Äôt the only one, kids would just be plucked out of group, disappear for hours at a time and once returned would be red faced, tears streaming, sometimes covered in blood, obviously battered, or worse.  As a group we could all hear the screams but we didn‚Äôt know where they were coming from exactly or who was screaming. We were expected to ignore it, sing a song, sing it louder to drown out the screams..

During my time there my life was stolen from me, I didn‚Äôt know where I was or who I was or who those people were. I was completely stripped. I was brainwashed, humiliated, raped, and tortured physically, emotionally and sexually. I was cut off from the world and had no one to rescue or save me. I was alone. Once, when I got on a high enough phase to see my mom, I tried to tell her. I begged her to take me home with her. She didn‚Äôt believe me. Our parents were brainwashed as well, they were told from day one to expect their children to lie and manipulate so they could go home. The next day I was punished so brutally that I would never do that again. I would do my time. I would do what was asked of me and eventually I would get out. 

I realized then that they hadn‚Äôt taken everything from me. I felt it somewhere, I knew it was there, somewhere inside of me was my fire and they couldn‚Äôt have that. That‚Äôs when I remembered  that I‚Äôd hidden something. I‚Äôd purposely broken a rule, an important rule. As little as this may sound to others, it was extremely important in my healing. One of the rules of the program was that we had to get rid of all our ‚Äúdruggie ties‚Äù. Music, concert shirts, anything THEY considered druggie. I‚Äôd never told my mom to get rid of my music. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard it in over a year and a half, it was back in my room in The Woodlands, and I was in Dallas. Music had always been a huge part of my life and I was unwilling to let that part of me go. My music was ultimately the light that brought me back, made me remember who I was, remember that I had reserved something for myself and made me continue the fight of my life. It was my secret and it kept me alive.

It took two years, 730 days, until they told me I was ‚Äúready to COMMENCE‚Äù. It was my graduation celebration. Celebration, what was there to celebrate? I found out later that in the history of Straight Inc. I was there longer than any female to date. Apparently, I had amazing insurance that just kept paying. I wish that was a joke but it‚Äôs not.

For a time after Straight, I was very lost. Trying to put myself back together took a long time and I went down some scary paths but I made it, still scarred but I‚Äôm alive and I‚Äôm happy. The experience has given me an understanding of the world and of people that I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôd have otherwise. Some of us weren‚Äôt so lucky, many of us committed suicide, and some of us were so broken they will never be able to live a normal life. I am one of the lucky ones.

Over time clients started coming forward and suing Straight, Inc. for the abuse they suffered and eventually all locations of Straight Inc. were shut down permanently. There have been many documentaries, movies, and news segments over the years and still today Straight Survivors trying to tell our stories. 

This is my story, many details left out on purpose, some things are sacred. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, yet empowering to know that I‚Äôm not alone. I hope if anything comes of this it‚Äôs to let another know they aren‚Äôt alone. ",11,0,meToo,SlayBelle013,1,2018-10-01 21:42:17

Was my stepsister a predator?,11,8vjgc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8vjgc5/was_my_stepsister_a_predator/,2,1530544925.0,"I made a separate account to post in this Reddit, but I have some concerns about some things that happened to me in my childhood. I‚Äôm currently 20 but these events happened at various times in my childhood.  I apologize if the timeline and story telling is choppy but I will try to be as clear as much as my memory allows. 

To avoid any confusion, I will start out by breaking down my sibling family tree. I have several step siblings but for the sake of this story I will only mention the ones relevant. I have a stepsister who is older than me by just a few months, related to me through marriage when my mother married her father. But since she was in the full custody of her mother (like most of my other siblings), we all only hung out whenever school was out during the summer, over breaks or on long weekends. We will call this main older sister, ‚ÄúMisha‚Äù. Misha was the oldest of the main four of us that were close. After Misha, I was the second oldest and then our other stepsister, ‚ÄúApril‚Äù and the youngest of us all was my full sister, Toni. All of us are pretty much the same age with the exception being Toni who is four years behind me. 

My sister Misha already had a pretty harsh upbringing with her mom being a drug user and letting Misha do pretty much whatever to whoever. She got expelled from a few schools for fighting and skipping classes. Never made it through high school as far as I know. I remember when we were all around about 12 maybe 13, Misha told us about how she was sexually assaulted by a best friends older brother. We were kids at the time and when she had told us she made it seem as if it was something she liked so it never registered that we should‚Äôve told an adult. Around this time is when things between all of us sisters changed. The first instance I remember Misha doing anything strange with me is that whenever all four of us spent the night together Misha always suggested that we shower in pairs. Her excuse was that it conserved water but considering how long all four of us girls showered there was no way it actually saved our parents money. Misha was the oldest so she always took charge and told who to shower with who and when. Somehow I was always paired with Misha, and Toni and April were paired up. There was never a certain order we all went in though. Whenever it was me and Misha‚Äôs turn to shower, we would go into the bathroom where we would lock the door (we were all pretty goofy so locking the door was to make sure no one busted down the door to throw god knows what at you while you shower or play with the lights). After starting the shower she would make me undress in front of her while she alway got undressed. This is about where my memory gets hazy but she would never let me leave the bathroom or shower until we were both finished taking our shower. She never penetrated me with anything or tried any inappropriate touching/kissing but it always made me uncomfortable to shower with her. She had a larger build than me and sometimes if I tried to avoid being in the shower at the same time as her she would get mad. This showering in pairs didn‚Äôt go on for long though as my dad saw that what was going on was in no way appropriate for sisters who were all at various stage of puberty. I often wonder if maybe this played some role in my twisted self image as I always found myself comparing my flat chest to her D sized chest and seemingly never ending attention from boys. 

Fast forward maybe a year or two to one particular summer where Misha accompanied my sister Toni, me, our mom and dad to the beach. I was already dreading going knowing that she would be there because she always made sexual remarks about my body or how ‚Äúpretty‚Äù I was. There was just something about her that made me uncomfortable. My family always gets a condo at the beach and since we didn‚Äôt own one we usually got stuck with a random one with however many rooms or beds we needed. That summer I remember being super bummed after walking into the condo and seeing that the room us three sisters were staying in only had two beds. Knowing that Toni slept wild and cold and I enjoyed curling into my fetal position underneath a crazy amount of blankets we chose separate beds. Of course Misha then chose the sleep in the same bed with me. I do remember trying to convince her to sleep with Toni but for some reason she insisted on sleeping in the same bed with me. We stayed at the beach usually for a week. I remember most nights that week, Misha would keep me up with her into the early hours after Toni had fallen asleep. It was mainly because Misha spent a lot of that time arguing with her then girlfriend on the phone and I was a light sleeper but she‚Äôd always jump on top of me or shake me to wake me up if I drifted asleep. When she would eventually get into bed she‚Äôd strip down to her sports bra and men‚Äôs boxer briefs. I usually just wore a tank top and pajama pants. She would complain that my pajama pants made her hot in the night so she would tell me to take them off so she wouldn‚Äôt get hot. What made me uncomfortable about it is that she would cuddle me and put her legs in between mine while I tried to sleep. It wasn‚Äôt just sharing a bed with her that made me hate this beach trip but also the constant sexual remarks about my body and her touching me in ways that made me uncomfortable. One remark in particular echoes all the time, she commented on my breasts one day she walked in on me changing, saying I ‚Äúhave porn star titties that‚Äôs hot‚Äù. Other times at the pool together she‚Äôd swim up behind me and grab my waist while pulling me into her pelvis or she‚Äôd slap my butt. I never brought any of it up to my parents because my mom was still grieving a death in the family and our dad was just happy that his daughters spending time together, I didn‚Äôt want to shatter that. 

I apologize for this being so long and probably so choppy. I‚Äôve always sorta buried these memories as being those weird sibling childhood memories but after talking to a few people I am close to I realized that older siblings doing stuff like this wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt normal. I guess you can see my concern after telling these stories to some close friends thinking they were funny growing up with siblings stories...

Much like anyone else in this world I‚Äôve been hit by hard times following leaving an emotionally abusive and controlling relationship and I‚Äôm just trying to work through a lot of things I myself haven‚Äôt dealt with...Any advice or kind words is deeply appreciated.

A #metoo revelation / What‚Äôs your number?,10,7vxo71,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7vxo71/a_metoo_revelation_whats_your_number/,0,1518023992.0,"I just had a slight emotional breakdown. The #metoo movement got me thinking back through my experiences of being a young girl in San Fernando Valley (LA) in the 90s. I wrote down the first experience and all of a sudden the other experiences hit me like a ton of bricks. There were 7 individuals on my list. 7. There were 7 different people who molested me in some way before I was 15. We just never talked about this kind of stuff in my family. From the beginning, from that first experience. We didn‚Äôt talk about it after. No one said anything. 

This is my takeaway from #metoo: we need to stop ‚Äúnot talking‚Äù about things that make us uncomfortable or embarrassed or shamed, especially when it comes to teaching the next generation. This is the reason these people are able to keep hurting. But knowing this, I now know I could talk about this but do I want to pursue action against these guys? No, not really. On the one hand I want to move on with my life. On the other hand, who‚Äôs to say this person still isn‚Äôt doing what they did to me because no one ever talked about it? For now I choose to not pursue but to spread awareness that this is a real thing.

7 guys before 15. Let that sink in. And I thought I hadn‚Äôt really been molested. I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs a geological thing? I guess it could be a combination of things. I want to know how common this is. What is your number? Mines 7.

I also commented on Alyssa Milano‚Äôs Instagram asking if she could repost this story as she claims to be an advocate for the Metoo movement. Also was ignored by her. Clearly Denny‚Äôs condones sexual harassment in the workplace and it‚Äôs their practice to safeguard perverts.

Harasser is the nicest guy in the world and my boss laughed along until he saw I wasn't.,10,aecotf,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aecotf/harasser_is_the_nicest_guy_in_the_world_and_my/,8,1547075761.0,"This harasser and I go back many months and we are both managers.  When I first came to this store he was the nicest person except I thought he was too touchy and over did the friendliness with the ladies as his girlfriend worked there also.  He's the kind of guy who can win anyone over and everybody loves him and would never suspect him to be a predator. 

One day, he dances at a young lady, 19, (he's 26) while crouching to her level and rubbing his nipples very close up on her.  She immediately turns away, and my jaw hit the floor. When she came near him again he hugs her up tight to him and rubs her arm.
I should have said something to him right then, but I thought it best to take it to the big boss and let her be aware of his actions so she could keep an eye on it.  I had no intention of getting him fired.  

He began to blaze around that somebody told on him for ""dancing"", which was a lie.  Soon, everyone knew it was me that told, they just didn't know my side of the story.  Of course, everyone loves him and feels sorry for him.  

He harassed me deliberately several times after that for which I never came forward about.  He would go out of his way to help me work, we could joke, but suddenly he would harass me and it came from nowhere.  Literally I said or did nothing to provoke it, doing my best to be forgiving and jovial.  

But then he harassed me in front of a manger higher than me.  He came from nowhere, stood right beside me, danced and said, ""she had a big ole butt!""  For no reason, just being vulgar.  My manager wanted to laugh along but saw I was serious.  Nothing was done. 

Months later my boss awarded him as manager of the year.  The manager who saw him harass me and I looked right at each other when it was announced.  It was pretty shocking to me.  The guy is just so lovable.          

Now today he harassed me again right in front of the assistant manager and several others.  He stuck two sticky receipt papers to each side of his breast, rubbed on them, and made hand motions as it he was fondling breasts.  He was aiming himself at me and my face dropped.  (removing this part becuzzzz))))))

I've documented everything, and I'll be taking this to my boss tomorrow. The sad thing is I didn't do this, yet, he has and will continue to blame me.  He's the unforgiving harasser.  All I did was protect a young lady from predatory behavior.  He could have just taken the advice and acted like a decent human being.  His fault. 

UPDATE:  Expected my other boss to be there this morning, she was not.  It was the male boss who witnessed it. I asked if he said anything to harasser and he said he did not.  Later he said he didn't even see him do anything, but that if he did what I said that it was inappropriate and agrees with the lady boss and harasser having a chat.  She is coming in this afternoon on her day off to have a discussion with harasser.  

Harasser had come in earlier for his shift.  He was very friendly and jokey.  Think he was scared.   

UPDATE 2:  First day to work with him since his chat with boss.  He is not happy with me.  Anything he had to give to me he threw down.  ",10,0,meToo,AmberJnetteGardner,1,2019-01-10 02:16:01

We were at breakfast prepping for a presentation to give to our Director and team.  During this breakfast meeting he felt that he needed to prep me for our national meeting.  He proceeded to tell me the following:

1.  ""Don't wear anything that too low where your boobs are hanging out""
2. ""Make sure your heels are not too high""
3. He explained to me that last year a girl got into the hot tub with her boss in her thong and he advised against me doing that because it will be talked about for the rest of my career.

I didn't react because I was in shock but this conversation made me very uncomfortable.  Is it ok for him to say these things to me?  What should I do?  Do I need to report to HR? ",11,0,meToo,girlitalian005,1,2018-11-22 16:59:54
I just have to get this out.,10,9yf24z,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9yf24z/i_just_have_to_get_this_out/,1,1542617459.0,"So around the end of May, my boyfriend bought me a phone. The only thing he said was no Snapchat and to be careful with who I gave my number out to. I gave it out to a few close friends and didn't really think much of it until I started getting harassing text messages from an ex. He had got it from one of my so-called ""friends"" and was relentless with his taunting. I had had harassers before and just blocked his number, but then he texted me from another number. It became a cycle of him getting new numbers and me blocking them. His harassing got worse and worse. He would attack my relationship, he would make claims that I abused him, and it only worsed when he got my boyfriends number. He would call the both of us all throughout the night (My boyfriend and I would always call at night so the calls wouldn't make noise but after 4 hours the calls would drop and I would be awoken again.). I had reached my limit when he began saying he was gonna rape me, he would mock me for being raped. Saying things like ""I would force you on your bed"". He has a good 200 lbs on me and lived down the street so the fear of him doing so drove my boyfriend and me crazy. My boyfriend changed my number and we tried to forget about it. My ex, however, tried viciously to get my number. He finally managed to get it when he threated to kill my friend's daughter. It started up again. It wasn't like he called or texted all day, I had to hide my phone when I was with my mom because she didn't know I had one. I only used it weekends and on Tuesdays when I was with my dad, but she found out Mid-July and I told her everything. She didn't believe it. She always adored this ex so it was hard for her to believe. After some convincing, I went down to his house with my mom to confront him only to have my claims torn down by his mother. He wasn't even there and supposedly didn't have a phone but was texting his sister the entire time. I had my number changed again shortly after and only gave it out to family and my boyfriend. I didn't hear from him for about a month so I thought it was over, I was wrong. He got my number again and continued his normal thing of making fun of me for being raped and attacking my relationship. Other people were getting harassed too. My friends were attacked by him as well and they knew that he would keep switching numbers just to keep from being tracked. We tried to call him out on it on social media in hopes of making it noticed after calling the police was failing to work. He turned it on us and blamed me and claimed to be a rape victim himself. I am trying to get a restraining order soon. Once it's done my boyfriend is gonna change my number for hopefully the last time. It finally seemed to die down since he focused more on another ex and getting sleep has been easier for me. My boyfriend and I still get the occasional harassing text or night call, but we just ignore it. (My boyfriend got a dick pic and wants to press charges, but thinks that the chode is punishment enough.) I'll try to post screenshots soon. I just had to get this all off my chest.

How many people are being persecuted in their own homes and are silent.  Their life partners are people who work from the beginning of their relationship to take away their personal power through isolation and play on their insecurities. We married people who felt we were property.  Who held us hostage in our own house by wielding power over us by withholding money or by using our children to manipulate us and hold us hostage.  

I was a stay at home parent for 16 years.  I was well respected in the community and I was forcibly raped multiple times during my marriage.

‚ÄúRepressed‚Äù does not equal ‚Äúmade up‚Äù,11,9ok3ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9ok3ms/repressed_does_not_equal_made_up/,2,1539662331.0,"I‚Äôm a little late to the Kavanaugh party. After all, our newest Justice has been confirmed and is currently sitting on the highest court of the land. At the same time, I find myself struggling with my own repressed memories and empathizing with Dr. Blasey-Ford.

There is an ongoing debate in psychological studies about the trustworthiness of recovered memories. From my own experience and the extrinsic evidence surrounding it, I believe such memories can be legitimate. I have no empirical data to opine on whether such experiences are the majority; I only have my own experience on which to base my opinion.

The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh brought up a flood of feelings for me. One feeling in particular stood out: desperation. Desperation for a feeling of acceptance and validation from those closest to me. And yet, that desperation remained raw and unresolved.

My own mother, the person I consider my fiercest ally, still questions my account of a sexual assault that took place when I was young. I was nine and victimized by the father of a friend I was visiting. I repressed the memory and did not allow it to surface until I was nineteen. And even though my mother was with me for every step after that fateful visit‚Äîfrom picking me up that day in tears and hearing me repeat, ‚ÄúI never want to go back there,‚Äù as we sped away in her Volvo, a trail of dust behind us; as we went to the doctor for my first ‚Äúfemale‚Äù evaluation soon after and learned that my hymen was somehow inextricably broken; and as I falsely accused a boy at school of touching me inappropriately‚Äîshe still thinks that I conjured the memories that came washing over me a decade after the event. 

Psychologists have since told me that I was too young at nine to process the trauma, and that I repressed it until I was old enough to deal with it. On top of it all, the perpetrator told me that if I told anyone what he had done, he would kill my whole family. In other words, I believed that he would destroy everything and everyone that I loved. Enough for a nine-year-old to stay silent and pretend nothing had ever happened.

I was on the phone with my boyfriend at the time I recovered the event at nineteen. I don‚Äôt remember what he said to me, but I remember feeling as if memories were suddenly unlocked and began appearing before me like scenes in a slide show. I fell to the floor in tears as they washed over me. The bedroom with the yellow floral bedspread. Wood paneling on the walls. The blinds over the window above the bed. The man with no face over me (I still can‚Äôt bring myself to see his face). The feeling of fingers inside me. My friend on the couch as I emerged from the bedroom, peering up at me under her bangs in a knowing way. Demanding in the kitchen to call my mother. Waiting desperately by the screen door for her car to appear up the dirt trail. Bolting from the trailer. Sobbing on the way home.

As we discussed Kavanaugh, Mom questioned Christine Blasey-Ford‚Äôs recovery of repressed memories. I responded by noting, ‚ÄúI know you have issues with repressed memories, given how you responded to what I told you.‚Äù She did not deny this or otherwise answer me except to nod, causing my heart to sink. Even now, almost twenty years after I told her what happened, almost twenty years after facing the evidence, she would still rather side with the fiction that nothing happened to me than to accept that she could not keep me safe that day and to validate my feelings and experience. In light of the extraneous evidence surrounding the events of that day‚Äîevidence that my mother acknowledges and yet seemingly dismisses‚Äîmy therapists have all agreed that my recovered memories are authentic. But Mom can‚Äôt bring herself to this conclusion. I suppose this is one more consequence of that fateful day that I will have to bear forever.

I am now the mother of nine-year-old twins. I pray that I can keep them safe, but I realize there are inevitably moments during which they are in the hands of strangers, and I must pray that they remain unharmed. I also pray that in the event my children are ever victimized, my eyes and ears are open then. As a last resort, if my eyes and ears fail me, I pray that my mind is open to reality.

And I still, and always will, love my Mama.",11,0,meToo,reallynnbridges1,1,2018-10-16 06:58:51

Its been so long and its been a secret this whole time, why would I wait so long? I was 8 years old, a child that had no idea what happened to her. I just knew I didn't like it, I was scared and confused but he was my big brother. I trusted him, when I told my mom the next day she took it to the church. She had him 'repent' and swept it all under the rug. My dad didn't know until I was 14 that it had even happened. And now I feel my silence has lead to her pain, and god knows how many other girls, I wonder if I was his first, I wonder how far he went, I wonder what happened to the others. How many other little girls did it happen to? I know it was at least 3 including myself, that should be too many. But as for me and the other girl, we will go unheard. We were too young to understand it was wrong, I feel for my Niece the most she is 13, and soon she will go to court against her own father, she will be forced to testify against him. I'm thankful for her bravery and strength, after months of silence she finally told us why she chose to speak up, ""I just don't want him to do it to anyone else ever again."" She was afraid he would do it again and again. I felt the same but even once I was old enough to testify, it didn't matter. I am just happy he will finally see justice, but not for me and the other girl, Only for my Niece. Now, if you made it this deep I have one question, is it wrong I want to put him away for life?

Because I have the right to decide who touches my body. Because threatening someone for telling the truth to protect your reputation is wrong. Because women everywhere regardless of race or ethnicity; regardless of sexual preference; regardless of income; of weight; of clothes on their backs; or sexual appetite. Regardless of brains, or brauns, or beauty; No girl who has ever lived has deserved to be touched where and when she doesn‚Äôt wanna. I will only use one name because I believe the threats that have been thrown my way. But I intend to out Travis Gajkowski. So that no one else gets hurt. Because I‚Äôm too tired to deal with the consequences of anyone else‚Äôs actions. You‚Äôre going to wonder why I‚Äôve chosen to use this name. ___ didn‚Äôt rape me. He didn‚Äôt post the video of my rape online. But what he did effected my life more. ___ continuously violated me for two years. He used his leverage as my now-fianc√©‚Äôs oldest friend to embarrass me out of saying much about it. It‚Äôs one thing to be taken advantage of by someone you barely know. It‚Äôs another thing entirely to be violated by someone you trust well enough and generally kind of like. Taking advantage of your body and taking advantage of your friendship are different kinds of betrayals. 

I‚Äôll start with a few statements: At Auburn University, I was stalked, drugged and raped. A video was made of it and posted online. There it is. That‚Äôs the sentence. There was a network of girls and boys helping my ex boyfriend stalk me for the months leading up to my rape, and though I cannot identify the man who raped me, though his face is turned away from the camera while my mouth lolls and my bleeding face hangs off of my own bed, I have to believe that so many people being preoccupied with my whereabouts (the rampant rape culture at Auburn University, in other words) helped my rape happen. Because I was drugged and unconscious for the rape, I didn‚Äôt really find out about it until I watched the video myself a few years later.

It was about a month after this that I met ___ , a friend of my fianc√©, P‚Äôs. This group he belonged to didn‚Äôt make a good impression at first. I overheard one of them call me a stupid sorority girl the first time he met me, and another asked if he could masturbate in front of me while P and I had sex the second time I visited his apartment. ___ was an awkward, but seemingly harmless guy. Everyone around him made it clear that he was still a virgin. I have to think that his awkward virginity afforded him liscence to do things other boys wouldn‚Äôt dare to like reaching into his friends‚Äô bras. The first time he ever groped me was New Years 2014. A few of us had gone up to Nashville. We were packed into a taxi. I was sitting on P‚Äôs lap when I felt rough nails digging into my breast. I went cold. It was such a weird violation. Nothing like that had ever happened to me in public. I was too young and shy to speak up for myself then. I just froze. I couldn‚Äôt move. I may have said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúUm, excuse me.‚Äù He retracted his hand from inside my bra. I may have turned to P and asked if he‚Äôd seen it. He hadn‚Äôt. I asked another one of the girls if this was something he did often. It was. 

It wasn‚Äôt just the groping that was awkward. He used to have the hateful outbursts at me. I didn‚Äôt know this guy that well at this point. He was just my boyfriend‚Äôs friend, but sometimes I‚Äôd make an offhand comment and he‚Äôd scream at me in front of everyone. It happened often. Even on my birthday two years in a row. He actually ended my 22nd birthday doing it. It was so awkward that half the people just straight up left. But then other times he‚Äôd confess something really personal like we were close. He told me about his panic attacks and I gave him a few at home tips to help with them. But then he‚Äôd turn around and grope me wherever he could whenever no one was looking at every turn. I went cold and still every time. He was my boyfriend‚Äôs oldest friend. I didn‚Äôt want to make our relationship weird by making him make some dramatic decision between the two of us. I spent most of that year doing social acrobatics to stay away from him. 

When most of our mutual friends had graduated and moved away, we found ourselves in the odd position of being some of the oldest students on campus. I was taking a lap year and he was in grad school. This was a semester that I spent a lot of time at home not wanting to party with younger kids and too lazy to make new friends after school and work. I met his new roommate and really enjoyed his company. Around this more progressive and feminist roommate, ___ never groped me. I began to play video games over at their house. We hung out so much, I got the courage to kindly confront him about the groping. He became very emotional about it and apologized profusely. He didn‚Äôt seem to understand why he did it. It seemed compulsive to him. He opened up about his many panic attacks and started seeing a therapist. We began an unlikely friendship and hung out almost every day. A few of our friends wondered if it was going beyond friendship, but I was still pretty heartsick for P even though we broke up when he moved to Austin the year before. It was a regular topic of conversation between ___ and I. But there started to be a lot of talk in his friendgroup about whether I‚Äôd take his virginity or not. I felt awkward and pressured. It was a really bad feeling, but it was either hang with he and his roommate or make brand new friends a month before I moved to Austin for an internship. I chose the former, but I regret it.

He did it again. I didn‚Äôt say anything right away. But the next time we hung out I asked if he liked me, wondering if that had something to do with it. He said he‚Äôd never really thought about it because P and I had dated. But later sometime (and I don‚Äôt really remember why) he ended up kissing me. I remember honestly being kind of proud of him. I was his friend and I knew he had a hard time putting himself out there like that. But I remember telling my girlfriends I just didn‚Äôt see him that way. I told him that too and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to kiss again. My birthday was really close to all of this and one of his girl friend‚Äôs got too drunk and called me a slut in front of everyone. I talked to one of our mutual friends about why and he sort of spilled the beans about what ___ had been saying about our relationship behind my back.

I cut contact after that. There was nothing left to say really. 

It doesn‚Äôt stop there, though. It was quiet for a long time. I‚Äôd cut contact, but P hadn‚Äôt. We were apart of a group message with them that I didn‚Äôt post to much, but I stayed in it because it seemed important to P to stay in touch with them. One or two of them were in Austin by then too and we saw them occasionally. Last fall my ovarian tumors came back, and this time they took 60% of my ovaries with them. P and I were both heartbroken, and with my new and terrifyingly short timeline to get pregnant, he and I had a lot of decisions to make together. Two weeks after we found out, I was surprised to be confronted with talking about it with someone unexpected. P had told some of the people in that group message. I was exhausted, my abdomen was sore, and my hormones were absolutely everywhere. On top of it, I‚Äôd never been a fan of this particular person. They‚Äôd tried a few times to break P and I up the way caddy girls in college do. It was an affront to talk about it at all, but especially with this person I‚Äôd always kept at an arms length. I still didn‚Äôt know if the tumors were cancerous or not. I was trying my best to keep it off my mind. I was grappling with my own mortality in a very real way when I heard her say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky. I don‚Äôt want kids. I wish we could switch ovaries.‚Äù I excused myself spent the rest of that party crying in the bathroom. It‚Äôs not evil to not want children, but it was tactless to confront someone with their own tragedy so casually. I tried to stay ahead of it after that. I told all of P‚Äôs friends in that group message just so I could be the one doing the telling this time. None of them reacted well. They all found a way to blame me or call me irresponsible for wanting to fight the illness taking my organs. The prospect of fertility treatments came up, and another one of them called me selfish for not wanting to adopt. Over the next two days he berated me over text message about my decisions and for feeling sorry for myself. 

Then ___ came in town to visit and after implying I was jealous of a new girl he liked, he told me people shouldn‚Äôt have children just because they have to. He implied that because I had made the decision to have kids by myself if P were to want to make another decision, I was trapping him into it. 

And then I lost it. I was done with all of it. I posted a list of all of my grievances against them and why I did not feel comfortable with them being around unless they apologized to their group message and left. Their only response was to threaten me with a lawsuit through my fianc√©. A few days after the threat, my cat died under extremely mysterious circumstances. 

I‚Äôm not stupid enough to think a court would care about what happened to me years ago nor would I ever dream of calling attention to the video I worked so hard to get off those sites. But I can hold one of them accountable here. I can out this specific evil for what it is and help society understand how wrong what happened to me is. Because it was so normal. Because it took a long time for me to even understand how anxiety inducing and unhealthy my day to day life was with that guy haunting my steps. This is not just my story. It‚Äôs plenty of girls‚Äô. It‚Äôs his female friends who helped threaten me. I‚Äôve spoken to people he went to high school with, it‚Äôs their friends‚Äô stories too. It‚Äôs probably girls he‚Äôs meeting now. 

And it might be yours, if you‚Äôre reading this. And you might need to know that sexual abuse is never acceptable on any level. I‚Äôm a cautionary tale. Shy girls, speak up when it‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs great to be a wallflower. Just have some thorns.",13,0,meToo,TheAtticGhost,1,2018-08-10 07:08:54

So I got a message from my gym that my (former, now) personal trainer is ‚Äúno longer working with us‚Äù. That‚Äôs it. No details. And I‚Äôm afraid I know why, but I‚Äôm not sure. 

He‚Äôs a guy probably in his 30s and I‚Äôm 17. When we were training he would make me do some...questionable things?? Like he would make me do squats but he would place his hand below my butt and tell me to ‚Äúsit in it‚Äù. He claimed it was ‚Äúto make sure I was going low enough‚Äù and ‚Äúhad the right format‚Äù but I‚Äôve been doing squats for years and I always thought I did them fine.  Another thing he would do is make me plank but he would always make me face him and keep my chin up. If you visualize this, you can probably imagine that seeing the chest would be much easier.  Another thing is he would make me lean back, spread my legs apart, and pull them towards my body as an ab exercise, yet he would always wants to ‚Äúhold my feet‚Äù to make sure I was doing it right. I saw him looking down at me. I would always wear Nike running shorts. 
And finally he just talked to me in a really weird personal kind of way, like I was one of his adult friends. He would talk about not being to smoke weed for three years since he was a teacher before he became a trainer and that one client I knew from school would come to training high. After I told him I went to  prom he asked me if I went to any after parties, I said no my parents won‚Äôt let me and I can‚Äôt drive, and idk it just seemed really creepy. 
He also wanted to tutor me in physics since he was a physics teacher previously. Every session he would ask if I talked to my mom about him coming to my house and tutoring me. I never did. 

Overall I‚Äôm not sure if he was fired because another woman (or man) reported him, all his clients I saw seemed to be women aged 16-30. It‚Äôs all just very strange to me. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting or misunderstanding something, for I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this.

How did this happen?,11,8k2vj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8k2vj0/how_did_this_happen/,4,1526548719.0,"I made a mistake. I didn't think it was a mistake, but clearly, I was wrong.

My roommate who moved out at the beginning of April said he wanted to come by and hangout. Hubs is away for work, but no bigs- this guy LIVED. WITH. ME. for almost two years. We were alone in the house together multiple times over that span and I never felt unsafe. I didn't think anything of inviting the person who lived with be for nearly two years back into my home. We both just celebrated birthdays days apart and it was ostensibly to be a private friends celebration. 

Tonight started like many other roommate hang-out nights. Some Jack, some smoke, some snow- nothing we haven't done together before. We were talking and chatting and having a good time....like we always have before. (note*- while we were doing drugs, I was fully in control of my faculties). 

Then he started making passes at me. I clearly stated that we were friends, family even, but never anything else. Then I went to bed. Thankfully I had the presence of mind to lock my bedroom door. I thought at the time that might be excessive.....but nope. 

Not long later, I heard him try the knob of my bedroom door. I thought, ""thank goddess I locked it,"" and was a little freaked, but thought that would send a clear message even if my words before hadn't. I hoped that would be the end and we could all go to sleep.

He'd been drinking, and he lived here, so I thought the passes at me were just a lapse in judgement and me going to bed would be the end of it. That's why I didn't just kick him out. I didn't want him drunk driving and....HE. LIVED. HERE. FOR. TWO. YEARS,

Nope. Next thing I know, after he finds my bedroom door locked, the fucking motherfucker climbs out the windows in the hall outside my bedroom door (2nd floor) onto the roof and starts looking in and trying to open my bedroom windows. I don't usually keep them locked....BONUS: He's fucking naked. I ran around and began locking them all, then hid under my quilt and texted my sister. I was afraid to call the cops because of the drugs. For awhile I heard him crawling around on the roof. 

I was fucking terrified. I fight guys four times my size in medieval armor, y'all. But in those moments, I was fucking trembling and hiding like a child. Bedroom door is locked and motherfucker is climbing around on the roof fucking naked trying to get in my bedroom windows. Mind you, this is someone I. LIVED. WITH. FOR. ALMOST. TWO. YEARS.

Sister asks if I know any neighbors to call. I don't. My closest friend is 10-15min away, but luckily wakes early. I texted her and she came to my rescue immediately. She helped me kick him out and stayed around awhile to make sure he didn't come back. 

Still can't sleep, and have to be on the metro at 7:30 anyway. I've never been so scared in my life, y'all. I just keep thinking, ""how did this happen?"" and feeling like I did something wrong. I can't stop trembling. I can't stop blaming myself. ",11,0,meToo,sweetEVILone,1,2018-05-17 12:18:39
The hypocrisy of Aziz Ansari's #metoo crucifiction,12,7rd9y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7rd9y2/the_hypocrisy_of_aziz_ansaris_metoo_crucifiction/,13,1516312190.0,"Whenever women want to talk about #metoo they bring up Harvey Weinstein, but really, how many men have stooped to Weinstein's level and done the things he has? Weinstein is a criminal monster - if only one of his countless victims had thought to go to the police, like crime victims normally do.

Men aren't Weinstein, men are Aziz Ansari, an awkward guy trying to get laid while at least trying to do the right thing. We're not rapists, we're horny, and we're stupid, and we've never denied it. We don't read minds, we rely on simple cues, like if you take your clothes off and start blowing us, then it probably means you're in us.

#metoo is spreading, and it's coming for YOU. YOU are Aziz Ansari. YOU are one of the names on the ""Shitty men in media"" list. Some woman, hiding behind an anonymous id, is going to post defaming, personal details about you, and she's going to be lauded for it. She's going to destroy you professionally and turn you into a pariah, and any attempt to twist yourself free will make the social media mob frenzy more. You are now in a kafkatrap.

Had some guy gone on a date with Amy Schumer, and outed her for being lousy in bed, for demanding head, for farting during sex, we'd currently all be clinically deaf from the collective shrill scream of indignation. #metoo should have stuck to obvious criminal behavior, but it wants to be a movement for change, and to do that it needs to turn all male action into crimes, and all men into criminals.

This started with my first step dad started to touch me at night time under the blankets after tucking me in. I just remember I didn‚Äôt like it. Felt too intense for me. I was 3-5 when these things occurred but I only remember probably the last bits when I was 5, the last time he did this was when my mom walked in on him giving me a bath and touching me. So she got divorced. Next was my older cousin (I don‚Äôt blame him because he‚Äôs mentally retarded) he was I think 15 and I was 5 and my mom was babysitting him this day and we were playing in my room. He grabbed a toy phone I had and threatened to call the police on me if I didn‚Äôt get naked. He just wanted to see I guess. The next time was my second step grandpa who was horrible and this occurred from ages 9-16. Yes I got pregnant from him when I was 15 which is a whole other story. Then when I was 14 I got harassed by a guy at work, I worked at the DQ and he sent me pervy Facebook messages and then basically one day he felt me up in the freezer room. The next time after that was I was freshly 18 and I was living with some older friends. I was babysitting for the girls baby. They came home offered me alcohol so I started to drink with them and then I got drugged by them and the two guys basically raped me. It‚Äôs fuzzy and I remember waking up freezing on the basement concrete floor and so sore in my girl parts and behind. I ran all the way home to my parents house and had a shower right away before going to work and I remember I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone that day. They all told everyone I was a slut and that I wanted to have sex with the two guys. So I lost all my friends. Then again at 22 I was raped by an old high school friend I went to his house and we were watching a movie and he made advances and then he laid me down and from there it got violent... I remember him saying after that he didn‚Äôt stop when you said stop because when  his gf‚Äôs would say stop it meant for him to keep going... that thought kind of haunts me and I‚Äôve wondered if he was raping them... anyways feel free to ask questions I just kind of wanted to get that out there and off my chest.

I was 5 years old at the time. My brother, sister and me had a 17 year old babysitter at the time. I always told her I had a 'crush' on her. 

Well, one day we were all playing hide and seek and my babysitter and I went hiding in a nearby tree house. In there she put my hand under her shirt and down her pants.

She told me to not tell anyone, so I didn't. Not untill I was 11 and realized that it was kinda f'd up (I just told me parents).

I never had any problems with it, nor has it ever bothered me at all, I just thought it would be nice to share this unusual abuse story.

Older guy creeped on my in 12 step program. He tried to be my sponsor and take advantage of me #metoo,10,aebx0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aebx0o/older_guy_creeped_on_my_in_12_step_program_he/,11,1547071190.0,"Originally, this poem (below) was meant for my eyes only. Feel free to skip this part and read the poem. I  posted this on reddit a few days ago but took it down out of fear of continued backlash from coming forward. I decided to repost it because I have nothing to lose. In the end, I have nothing to be afraid of because I‚Äôm telling the truth and none of this is my fault to begin with. 

To give you some context, I joined a 12-step program over the summer. I was 26 at the time (27 now) and a 58-year old ‚Äúold-timer‚Äù approached me and offered to help me. At first, he seemed caring and had some helpful advice. Plus, we are both gay men. I figured and older, wiser gay man who faces similar life challenges would be a good mentor. So, I let him be my sponsor. Over time, it became more obvious that he was using his position to try to coerce me into a relationship with him instead of helping me. All he talked about was sex, in EVERY conversation. He made me and other participants uncomfortable. He purchased porn videos and lube for one of his sponsees at an adult store as a gift. Yet, he was so loving and helpful at the same time, it was easy to write it off as ‚ÄúHenry just being vulgar.‚Äù We were all brainwashed. 

He has 8-years sober so he‚Äôs definitely one of the good guys in this program. Right?

Even though I‚Äôm an adult, he used all of the same grooming tactics that child molesters use: made a daily presence in my life, isolated me from other members, desensitized me by talking about sex, etc. One thing I didn‚Äôt mention in the poem is that he also bought me gifts, another thing child molesters do. The worst part of this is that he works with kids. Special needs kids. I hope I‚Äôm wrong about him and that when it comes to kids, that he has at least one boundary. He certainly had none with me! I hope he‚Äôs not a pedophile. Even if he‚Äôs never touched a child though, he‚Äôs still a sexual predator. 

He targets adults who much younger than him. I don‚Äôt know if his targets include kids but I don‚Äôt care. I have no reason to think the kids he works with are safe with him. Would you?

When I came forward, key leaders in the program defended him. This poem is about the aftermath of coming forward. 

It really sucks to feel trapped in this addiction for years, finally see a way out, and then have this happen. 
 
Here is the poem:
CONTENT WARNING: Sexual abuse

********************************************

The 13th Step

Mr. M*****a,
 
Thank you for giving me the emotional support I needed. We just met and hour before. I was relieved. Someone wanted to hear me out because my soul was depleted. 
 
It was my first day at the fellowship, I had no idea what to expect. Marijuana Anonymous. Wow, for once I could tell people about my addiction, and they wouldn‚Äôt object. 
 
You constantly talked about sex to test my reaction. You‚Äôre more than 30 years my senior and you still wanted action. You found a way to work it into every conversation. So, I don‚Äôt owe you anonymity, or a private confrontation. 

But I was afraid I‚Äôd offend you, if I told you I was uncomfortable. So you continue to desensitize to a point. You told me to ‚Äúwhack off when you feel like using‚Äù one night, and I thought it was normal.
 
You. Told. Me. to come to your car after that first meeting, so we could talk. About addiction, I thought. Not what you do with your cock. 
 
There were times you helped me when I was a mess. But you secretly wanted, to cum on my chest. 

Your ‚Äúemotional support‚Äù gave me a new escape. In hindsight it‚Äôs clear those long personalized texts, were a conspicuous attempted rape. 
 
You sent daily readings, to everyone else. When I outed you publicly they told me ‚ÄúHenry is such a nice guy though.‚Äù Forget the dirty talk, ‚ÄúHenry was just being himself‚Äù. 
 
They trusted you like I did, and they all took your side. While I still go to work every morning, after I get high. 
 
‚ÄúNick, what if you‚Äôre wrong? There were teachers here tonight!‚Äù What if I said nothing, and turned out to be right?
 
Someone told me the district leader, would be dismissive. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs true, she‚Äôs more than complicit  
 
You groomed me like a child and were as sly as a fox. But I‚Äôm ‚Äúa danger to the group for making such serious accusations,‚Äù she said. Her name is Susan (C*****i) C*x. 

Fuck her anonymity, and her invented rules. They only let Henry ‚Äúwork the program‚Äù with his ‚Äútools.‚Äù

She said if I was ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù that I should have told him. She said I‚Äôm the danger, even though I‚Äôm his victim. 
 
Predators groom everyone around them, including you. So, no one will believe their victims, when they say #metoo
 
He‚Äôs a works for J****** Elementary, a Special Ed Technician. You only need a high school diploma, according to their description. 
 
I‚Äôm an adult but is Henry a villain? Is it a coincidence, he took the easiest job, with the most vulnerable children?

Leaders like Susan, protected Weinstein for decades. Henry may not be Harvey, but predators come in all shades. 
 
There‚Äôs so much I want to say but I can‚Äôt fit it here. So much of what I‚Äôve already said, has fallen on deaf ears. 
 
The courts and schools send troubled teens here. But if they ever need to scream, no one will hear. 

I‚Äôm tired of feeling responsible, for bringing him down. It‚Äôs not my fault. I never wanted this. I outed him to protect MA, but they treated me like a clown. 
 
Now let me ask you, if sexual abuse was water, would you let someone drown?
 
Sincerely, 
Nick",10,0,meToo,nickydaly,1,2019-01-10 00:59:50

And let me tell you, I idolized him. He was my best friend, he would pick me up from day care, show me music, I don‚Äôt know he was my older brother, why wouldn‚Äôt I? My parents left him to babysit me a lot, I mean it makes sense, free baby sitter. But one day, he got something in his head against me. He told me to come watch this movie in his room, it was my favorite movie at the time. (Over The Hedge). I went to go watch like I usually do and he told me his belly button hurt. And he needed me to suck it to feel better. I think you can tell, it wasn‚Äôt a belly button. Looking back, I just think I was dumb. I was five, I knew what belly buttons look like ya know? I don‚Äôt know why I went with it. But, It happened twice apparently. I remember it happening more, but my mom swears it happened twice. I don‚Äôt remember telling them what happened but apparently I told my mom I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it. I felt wrong, turns out I was right. He moved out that year and I repressed the memory for a few years. It came up recently in therapy, and my mom told the therapist that he told them it never happened, I made it up.They believed me. But I‚Äôve wanted to confront him recently. Maybe.

I called them all Uncle Gary, or Uncle John, or whatever. I don't think I ever knew any of their actual names. One of them was called Uncle Clarence. (Uncle C) Uncle C was I'd say dads favourite, because he was always over. They would kiss, and hug and be very touchy, but my dad just said it was just, ""friendly greetings"". I bought it all the way and never suspected a thing. But there was alway something... off, with Uncle C. He would stare at me constantly when my dad wasn't in the room, he would talk to me strangely and tell me how pretty I was looking that day, he would touch my shoulder whenever I sat next to him... It just made me creeped out. I didn't tell my dad because I didn't want to ruin their friendship, and he gave me gifts. The gifts were weird too. Small pants, crop tops, hats, earrings... (I was 6-8) One day, my dad was going to the store to buy something, and left me all alone with Uncle C. I was watching TV when he walked up and sat next to me. I was uncomfortable, both physically and mentally, because he was a bigger guy and was pushing me up to the corner of the couch. He noticed after a bit and offered for me to sit on his lap. (There was another couch that I could've sat on, btw) I declined, but he Insitided. I didn't  want to be considered rude, so I did. He put his hands on my shoulders. I was so uncomfortable, and Spongebob was just playing the whole time. ""Do you like this show?"" ""Huh... Oh uhh... Y-yeah, it's one of my faves."" ""I like you"" ""E-h uhh, y-yeah sure.."" I was so scared. I watched crime shows often and they started something like this. ""I have to go to the bathroom!"" ""Me too, can I come with?"" ""I-i don't know, I don't need help."" He still followed me as I walked to the bathroom. I tried to go in without him, but he said he was coming with. He started getting aggressive, so I pushed the door shut. I locked the door and he banged on the door. ""I'm an authority figure! Listen to me,  OPEN THE DOOR!"" My dad told me to listen to my family, and since I thought he was my uncle, I obligated. He was furious that I locked it, and he hit me. I cried, and he kicked me. That made me cry harder, and he beat me up. When he was done, he told me if I ever told on him, he would hurt my dog. I told my dad when he left the family and broke up with Uncle C, and he called the cops. I don't know what happened to Uncle C, and I'm worried he could hurt someone else. I have never heard from or seen Uncle C, and I wish I told on him sooner. (My father broke up with Uncle C and left 3 years later) ",11,0,meToo,MorganCrystals446,1,2018-12-04 00:58:35

I'm not good at typing things up super fast and I've got work in the morning


I got out of this relationship in june 2018. Im 19. This is going to be long because I feel like a little bit of background might show why I was so naive. Please forgive me, when I write I'm all over the place with the timeline and just jumbled thoughts and emotions. I had gone to the same school in an itty bitty town in the middle of nowhere for a decade. I was an outcast probably due to my weight and me being socially inept for most of that time. Never had any real boyfriends. ""Dated"" a guy from the next town over for about 10 months freshman year. That was all done over Facebook messenger. Never actually met irl more than a handful times. He was skeezy and manipulative and of course I thought that was ok. Didn't date anyone again til senior year. Let a guy shag me cause I thought he'd like me. Dated a guy 3 hours away he ghosted me furthering an anxiety disorder that has been getting worse over the last few years along with various home issues. Mom found out that instead of me staying with my grandmother (who I'm not fond of), I was staying with my two best friends (Hope and Greg) She took away my car and basically trapped me with her at her new condo an hour away for the remainder of senior year and a little after. At that point her bf thought I was some hooligan. Then right before graduation I get with (let's call him) Todd. I met him through my middle school best friend (let's call her) Jess. I hitched a ride out to her place and I was ready to hook up with whoever. He started texting me about his hobbies and stuff tho. I said let's meet up and if course we had sex but he didn't realize I wasn't looking for anything serious. He was opening doors for me though and was seemingly sweet and funny and I really liked his family which I met that day because he lived in the basement. Honestly that's what pains me the most about leaving him in the end is his mom and his little sister. I still miss them and think about them. We hooked up, he asks me if I wanna go out, I say yea why not. About a month and a half in i move in with him. No word to my mother, just leaving overnight. She finally let go of me. He showed more and more of his bad side over the next few months. Trying to start shit and make me feel like I was the crazy one, then saying sweet things. I'm sure that during this time, he cheated on me physically with other girls because later I put two and two together. I was really blind. So blind and not in my right mind. There had been no breaks for me mentally for 7mo up until I got with him then almost a year of overwhelming feelings with him all the time until I was numb and then gone. The first few months were confusing, then Jess got me shitfaced for the first time. Always getting me into trouble. I knew he was talking to other girls and I called him out on it. I lost a lot of weight during this time. He of course apologized but would still turn around and treat me like shit. This part is what had me confused and fucked up. It still has me messed up. He was really upset with me for basically no reason. I see he's messaging some strange girl and she's sending selfies to him. I ask who it is and he snaps at me. I'm trying not to cry and I'm pleading with him to calm down and give me some lovin. He says to turn off the lights and roll over and I said ok knowing what he was wanting. I was still crying. I didn't want to. But I didn't say no. I didn't say anything. Just laid on my belly trying not to sob and I let him do what he needed to. And when we were done, he rolled away from me like always. I asked him if we were okay and he  said ""I don't know. Shut up and go to sleep"". Around this time, I started having an issue with alcohol. He was trying to get away from me all the time. I kept catching him in his bs. I didn't want to go back to my mom's and I didn't want to leave my new home with my new family. So I left him alone. Over the next couple weeks, I was drinking heavily and using the whisper app to go and hook up with guys. There were 4. The first one, I was staying at a friend's that I met through Todd. I couldn't sleep so I went on the app and someone nearby was wanting to hook up so I started messaging him. I didn't think I was actually going to go out but I suddenly was wide awake and I couldn't get this knot out of my stomach. I figured  why the hell not. Why should I care. So he picked me up at the gas station down the road. We smoked weed, talked, and messed around for few hours. Gave him my number cause whatever he had was hella good. He'd message me every now and then over the next few months but I'd never respond. He called me kitten.  The second one was a manager at arbys. He bought me vodka and we went to the store he worked at after hours and he made me free food then we went back to his place and we hooked up. Third one I was at my grampas out in the middle of nowhere and I just couldn't sit still. I couldn't stay there. I had to get some booze. So this guy drives almost an hour to come get me, bought me vodka, and took me back to his parents house to have sex with me. As soon as he gets the drink, I down a fourth of it. By the time we get where we're going, I'm super drunk and I can't even remember more than his room. He was 27 and I had just turned 18. He says he wants to get a place with me and then we talk for a while. I can't really remember what about. We were there until almost 6 then he took me back to my grandpas. The fourth one was actually pretty nice but at this point I was feeling pretty exhausted from all this. It felt stupid and I was just doing it out of anger. So I get drunk, we hook up in the parking lot of a park down the street from my mom's. He was so bad at kissing, he was licking all over my face and scratching his stubble on it too. We parted ways after that. I think I still have him on sc. the last time I tried to go off with somebody, he didn't look anything like his picture. We met at a gas station. I had a really bad feeling about it but I got in his car anyway. Immediately he was saying we would only have a couple hours cause he was babysitting even though he said we'd hang out all day and I'd get booze. I didn't say anything. He put his hand on my thigh and asked me what was wrong. I said I needed to get out. Thankfully he did pull over at store along the street. I quickly said sorry and thank you and opened the door. He grabbed my arm and asked ""where's my hug?"" I froze for a second then gave him what he wanted. I was scared and not sure what to do. Then he grabbed my neck and tried to make me kiss him. I broke away and escaped the car, shutting the door behind me. Walking home was the scariest part because I was constantly looking behind me to make sure he didn't follow. Things with Todd seemed ok for a while. He noticed I was never home so he put in slightly more effort for a few months. Then I saw over his shoulder he was on plenty of fish one night. I waited until he was asleep and made a fake profile and look at his. Low and behold her was on it not even an hour earlier. I jumped of so angry I was hollering and calling him a whore and a jerk and he tried to pretend like nothing happened and I showed him. He said it was for making 'friends' and that I was being crazy. I cried for the next couple hours and he convinced me that it was only for friends and that he wouldn't use it anymore. He never deleted it  in all the time we dated. It became obsessive to the point where I was checking his sc to see when he was active and where he was at and facebook location and on pof hed be online while he was 'using the bathroom'. I really hate that part of my life. Even when I was doing it I hated it. We started arguing more often but I actually never mentioned the social media. It was always him just telling me to chill cause I was too happy or excited or him telling me that I was being too much it talking to much or just everything I did would irritate him and bother him and sex became a chore. One time I started my period while we were having sex and he shoved me off of him. My legs would get tired so I'd ask if we could stop or change positions. He'd say cmon and I didn't want to argue. I was starting to get tired. I almost died at Jess' one night, I had gotten black out drunk and was puking and pissing on myself and pissed the bed and she never bothered to roll me onto my side, I could've gotten alcohol poisoning or choked on my vomit. Todd said he didn't care, i wasn't his problem, and shortly after, the only time I've had an actual confession from one of the girls he cheated on me with, came to light and i tried to leave but he guilted me into staying. He started getting more physically violent. He hurt my foot, wrestling wasn't play anymore it was malicious, he'd grab me and shake me, and he broke the TV. He told me ""I just want to kill you sometimes"". But I'm crazy because one time I was angry with myself and slammed a drawer shut or yelled at him for being on a dating site. Which later I saw a notification for hot or not and somehow I allowed home to convince me it was for friends again. I was so exhausted I'd believe anything. For the last few months I was growing numb to him. I had met my wonderful group of friends I have now and my current bf AND current roommate through a coworker at my last place of work before I left him. Todd was in the hospital for an infection. During that time, I started hanging out with these people more and current bf (let's say boobutt) üòÇ I started having boobutt over to hang out while my mom was out of state and I was moved back in with her. He started cuddling with me and being all sweet and cute n shit and I was like welp I can't spend another night with Todd knowing I don't want to be with him anymore and I'm falling for this other guy. So, I break up with him, he obviously acted like a duck about it, I cried for an hour, pet some cats, got over it, and now I'm with boo butt. Who has been nothing but supportive, and sweet and patient. After over a year with shithead it's been really hard getting used to being with someone who actually treats me well and always wants to be around me and kiss me and cuddle me. He's all I've ever wanted and he's just the biggest nerd. I've had flashbacks of course but I'm slowly getting through it. A lot of the time there's a little todd in the back of my head saying mean things and making me feel like I don't deserve boobutt but I know things will get better. I don't regret my relationship with him only because it helped me to grow up more. Idk how to conclude.

I'm a victim of sexual violence, I say ""victim"" because I can't feel confident saying ""survivour"" because I don't feel like I'm able to move past it yet, I don't feel like I've successfully survived it yet. I have PTSD and depression because of it, I've felt suicidal because of it, especially lately I feel my symptoms at my heels, like they're pursuing me, trying to engulf me, like it's an insatiable darkness trying to swallow me.

I admitted what happened to me to a counseling staff person at my university today. It was in an email. I don't know what they'll do, what they'll say, how they'll react. The attack happened on my university campus, I haven't admitted to anyone in a long time, years, and I'm not sure how it will go. I'm really desperate and I need help. I've been feeling not very well lately, things haven't been going well, the university might evict me from my apartment. If they take it seriously this will be the first time anyone from my university has. It's odd too because I'm in Atlantic Canada as well, just at a different university but still a long  history of inactivity and denial with dealing with incidents of sexual violence on campus. I'm hoping things have improved, but I'm just really scared, scared no one will believe me again, and scared of being hurt after trusting someone at the university again, and then having them throw my symptoms in my face or tell me I'm faking it, or lying.

Trigger warning for childhood sexual abuse and rape mentioned

My father was my first sexual abuser. I was 5 when it started and 18 when it finally stopped. It happened every other weekend all weekend long because my parents were divorced. but because I developed Dissociative Identity Disorder to cope with the trauma I didn‚Äôt actually realize it had happened until I was 22. When the memories finally resurfaced it started as nightmares which I shared with my (now ex) boyfriend. I was going through a lot and my sex drive diminished greatly. My ex would with-hold comfort and affection unless I gave him the amount of sex that he wanted. It was very difficult to deal with. I now know that things like that are called coercion and is also illegal but the final straw was one evening in May two years ago when I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to do any more, that I just wanted to go home. He forced me to relive one traumatic event from my childhood. It triggered my dissociative identity disorder and I couldn‚Äôt fight back, I couldn‚Äôt scream, I was totally blank. After that he took me home. It took me two weeks to fully realize what had fully happened and I immediately broke up with him... I realized almost right away after the break up that I had nothing, no way of proving what had happened. I have no evidence to any of what has happened to me in my life time. All I have is my memories and the trauma caused mental illness. Recently with all the cases in the media my illness has been triggered more often. People often act like not remembering a moment to the letter is a sign of dishonesty when in many cases it is simply a sign of severe trauma and a sign that people have suffered severe abuse. My father passed two months after my break up and I was treated horribly by his family after it. I strongly believe in innocent until PROVEN guilty in a court of law so because I have NO evidence I have not and will not report. But talking about it helps me stay in touch with reality. It‚Äôs refreshing and soothing when someone believes what I say without judgment. #MeToo #whyidon‚Äôtreport ",9,0,meToo,Lady-Witch,0,2018-10-02 22:44:55
Got sexually assaulted in a car,11,9iqvrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9iqvrg/got_sexually_assaulted_in_a_car/,8,1537870323.0,"So, i feel the urge to share my story bcs i dont really know how to deal with this. 
And i actually dont know where to start.

I went to a party and wanted to sleep over at a friends house because this party was hosted in a village near my friends‚Äò. 
So i ended up being really drunk. At about 4 am the party was over and i started looking for my friends so that someone could pick us up and drive us home. Turned out, that my friends drove home because one of them was way too drunk to stay any longer at the party. So i talked to a guy (a high school friend of mine) and he offered that his cousin could give me a ride home. I was happy that i found someone who could help me get home so i agreed on that. 
We walked up to the car of his cousin and took a seat in the car. I was sitting in the back of the car and my high school friend sat next to me. His cousin was talking to some random guy outside of the car.
And thats where my actual story starts.
This ‚Äûfriend‚Äú started to unbuckle my belt and shove his Hand in my pants. I told him to stop and wanted to pull his hand out but he was too strong and pushed his hand even further in my pants and i couldnt manage to make him stop. I begged him to let go of me but he wouldnt listen. 
His cousin was about to enter the car so this boy whispered in my ear ‚ÄûDont say a word or my cousin will notice what we are doing‚Äú 
i was way too afraid to say something anyways.
So his cousin started the car and drove. We drove on a field path because that was the fastest way to reach our destination. My high school mate opened his pants, grabbed me by my head and pushed me down. He shoved his Penis in my mouth and pushed my head down so that i could hardly breath. I wanted to put my head back up but he wouldnt stop pushing me down and i didnt have the strength to lift my head up. 
I was too afraid that if i say a word, i would have to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere on a dark country lane (i‚Äòm terribly afraid of the dark) or that he would beat me up. 
Finally we reached the house of my friend and i jumped out of the car and ran inside.
I cried the whole night and started cutting again (was ‚Äûclean‚Äú for nearly 3 1/2 years) 
I dont want my parents to know because i feel ashamed. I just dont know how to deal with this (i wont take legal actions, because it wouldnt change anything. It already happened to me now and legal actions wont change that) 
Can someone please tell me what i can do to cope with this Situation?

He used a machete and cut both her arms completely off when she walked ahead instead of responding to his crude remarks. 

My father heard her story through a post shared on Facebook, and took matters into his own hands after the Dominican Republic government denied Cielo's father's call for help. My father contacted The Shriners Hospitals for Children in Boston, and they have generously offered to cover a lot of the expenses for providing Cielo with prosthetic arms and hands, in a procedure to be done starting in August 2018.   


However, there are other expenses that are not covered, such as lodgings for her mother, who is travelling with her to Boston. Plus, of course, food, transportation, and other incidental expenses. In a time of #metoo raising awareness about sexual harassment, Cielo also needs our support. Please help us to help this young girl so that her future is as bright as her optimism and her smile.

My Friend's Rapist is Suing Her,8,8omntt,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8omntt/my_friends_rapist_is_suing_her/,7,1528160556.0,"My friend (I'll call her Anna, 22) goes to a nice liberal arts school on the East Coast. This girl is one of the strongest, most talented, and down to earth people that I know. She is one of my favorite people on the planet and has always been there for me, and all of the people in her life.

Anyways, Anna was a member of a social group that does a weekend trip once a year, and while on one of these trips, she was drugged and raped by another member of the club (I'll call him John, 22.
She ended up having a manic episode as a result of the trauma and after one of her professors mentioned her odd behavior to health services, she was charged to a mental ward for a few days. While she was staying here she asked for a rape kit and was refused one because they thought it was just a part of her episode (this is illegal by the way).

She ended up filing charges with the school police (not the actual police) and they started investigating. They invoked some temporary restrictions on him while the case was being investigated, but eventually he was let off totally free. Basically, there was just no firm evidence because she had mostly blacked out as a result of the drugs and had no dna evidence since she was denied a rape kit earlier. Meanwhile, this kid is directly related to someone sitting on the board of said university, and I saw the final police documents and they clearly ignored some evidence, like the fact that this kid had raped two other girls, one in almost the exact same way.

So this all happened in the Spring. For the last year or so, she has just been on the grind, working on herself, getting better, going to school, all that. Then one day, she gets a letter in the mail. She is being sued by her rapist John for upwards of $200,000, for defamation, libel, emotional damages, etc. All she did was report it to the school police (which is what everyone tells you to do).

I believe that in order to get off the school charges, John had to tell his family that he didn't do it. His family, who come from old money and own a law firm, then say, well if you didn't do it then this girl is crazy and the right thing to do is sue her. John, not able to get out of it without confessing, then agrees to sell his soul and press charges against the girl he assaulted. This will cost John absolutely nothing, soul aside, since his family members are lawyers, but if Anna looses she will have to declare bankruptcy. Even if she wins, lawyer fees will cost her about 50k, and her family doesn't have much as it is.

Anyways reddit, what can I do? I am in disbelief that just for filing a school police report, you can be charged with libel. Are there resources or funds that can help with lawyers expenses in these types of situations? This seems like the exact sort of story that would go viral. A kid born with a silver spoon who has assaulted several people presses charges using his dad who is a lawyer while another one of his family member sits on the board of the school, idk. 

Any help at all, even pointing me to a different subreddit, would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR: My friend was drugged and raped. She was refused a drug kit illegally. She filed charges with the school (her rapist's family member sits on the board of the school) and the school found no evidence even though he has assaulted two other girls. A year later, he sues her for over $200,000. His family members own a law firm so it will cost them nothing while she doesn't have the money.

I heard from other women he'd done similar bizarre things to them in years past.

I heard him interviewed on a radio program today and it just got my cockles up. He used his position to intimidate, harass, and defame more than one woman. By featuring him in anything, it gives him more clout, more weight to throw around and scare more women, isolate them from communities, exclude them from public spaces.

I want to contact the reporter to at least attempt to shed some light on this problematic person. I even have a friend with connections to a local paper that said this may be a story they'd pickup.

I'm not saying he's the most upstanding guy for doing the basic, decent, and morally and legally obligated thing, but come on, Grace, don't take advantage of this movement for your own gain; it's already tough enough for actual victims of sexual harassment and assault to be taken seriously (something that I'm glad is gradually changing).",12,0,meToo,Normiekek,1,2018-01-19 18:10:42
How I accidentally accused a guy of sexual harassment,10,7r75rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7r75rx/how_i_accidentally_accused_a_guy_of_sexual/,5,1516249243.0,"In the fall of 1992, when I was nineteen years old, I worked in the AV department of the college library. The AV director, Jim, was a stocky, balding guy in his forties, an ex-Marine who had an endless repertoire of stories and jokes.

This story isn‚Äôt going to go the way you think.

Whenever Jim and I got a call from a desperate instructor struggling with classroom technology, off we‚Äôd trot across campus with our coaxial cables and vacuum tube testers (again, 1992), me following behind pushing the VCR cart. We were the dynamic duo, and in our downtime we chatted about books and movies and travel and crazy people we knew. We got to be friends, and he talked to me like I was a grownup, not a kid. This story isn‚Äôt going to go the way you think.

One day one of the other student workers (whose first language was not English) made a comment about me and Jim, and when I called him on it he replied, ‚ÄúWell, Jim thinks you are crushed on him.‚Äù

What the fuck? Jim, my buddy Jim who reminds me of my dad‚Äôs brother, thinks I have a crush on him? Right away my mind played back a million scenarios where ‚Äì I now realized ‚Äì I could have given that impression. Shit. So that afternoon, feeling small and stupid, I asked Joanne (the assistant director) if I could transfer to the Tech Services department. Naturally, she asked why.

And I told her.

A week later I got a letter in my campus mailbox (we didn‚Äôt have a campus email system in 1992), printed on college letterhead and signed in blue ink by‚Ä¶the Dean. It was a summons to a ‚Äúformal meeting‚Äù between me, Jim and Joanne, to ‚Äúclear up the situation.‚Äù

I went back to my dorm room, plugged in my Brother WP-80 word processor, and tapped out a terse reply that, no, I would not be attending this meeting. I had neither requested it nor wanted it, and as far as I was concerned the matter was resolved; I was happy with my transfer and had nothing more to say.

Because I knew what this was. My campus ‚Äì and every other college and university across the country in 1992 ‚Äì was scrambling to put in place a set policy on sexual harassment after the uproar over Anita Hill‚Äôs testimony against Clarence Thomas. And ok, sure, YES we should have a policy in place, and sure, NO inappropriate behavior between a superior and subordinate should ever be tolerated, especially in an environment where there were so many vulnerable young woman. But THAT. WASN'T. WHAT. THIS. WAS. 

What I remember feeling at the time was a quietly seething rage that my own agency had been subverted. Apparently Joanne, perhaps meaning to mentor me (or perhaps out of some other motivation I‚Äôm not aware of), took it upon herself to advance my ‚Äúcase‚Äù to the Dean‚Äôs office, and they took it from there. There was no question in my mind that this letter had zero to do with concern for my well-being and everything to do with the college covering its own legal ass. I resented it then, and I resent it now. If I‚Äôd wanted to complain to the Dean, I for damn sure would‚Äôve done so myself. How dare they treat me like a child?

This is where I‚Äôm at now with the motherfucking #metoo movement, which has become a neo-Victorian push to view women as fragile objects incapable of agency, and which carries an unmistakable whiff of sex-negativity.

It‚Äôs 25 years later, and rape culture is still real. Sexual assault and sexual violence and sexual objectification are still rampant, only we haven‚Äôt learned how to talk about them without losing our fucking minds. It seems too much to ask that people might consider that there might be gradations of morality between a coarse joke, a hand lingering on the buttock, and violent penetration. It is blasphemy to consider that there are shadings of credibility between believing every alleged victim and believing none of them.

Aziz Ansari‚Äôs accuser (who hides behind a pseudonym) isn‚Äôt much older than I was in 1992. She is not a victim of anything but her own emotional immaturity and bad judgment. We‚Äôve all had bad, awkward dates where communication didn‚Äôt flow freely, and ended up feeling disappointed and maybe even slightly used. But her refusal to consider any kind of active agency herself, either in the moment or in retrospect, is nauseating. There‚Äôs a thing I like to call The Mashed Potatoes Theory of Consent: if you want some, you say yes. If you don‚Äôt want any, you say no. Real life isn‚Äôt always that simple ‚Äì there are nonverbal cues and power dynamics and mixed emotions, and a million other factors that can muddy the waters. And, even when you‚Äôre naked in a guy‚Äôs apartment, you have the moral and legal right to change your mind at any time (even, as my dad once put it, ""on the fourteenth stroke"").

But, by her own account, she never said no, or signaled nonconsent in ANY overt way. He may well have misread her unwillingness as nervousness and was trying to put her at ease. He may not have noticed her ambiguity, because he‚Äôs not a fucking mind reader. She could have used this experience as the basis for a different essay, one in which she realizes that playing grownup games requires abiding by grownup rules, that a big part of being a grownup is reflecting on what you learned from the experience and what you‚Äôll do differently next time. Instead, from start to finish, she‚Äôs determined to see herself as a victim. (He wanted to go straight to his apartment after the restaurant! That monster!) If she gave Ansari a blow job simply because she felt ‚Äúpressured,‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure how well she‚Äôll do at a car dealership or a time-share seminar. Toughen up, ‚ÄúGrace,‚Äù because life will fuck you worse than Aziz ever did.

I've thought a lot over the years about how I could've handled the Jim situation differently. I might sit and talk it out with him ‚Äì or, more likely, joke about it and/or make constant references to my boyfriend. I might not let unsubstantiated office gossip drive my decision-making in the first place. Or I might simply have not given a shit what Jim or the other student workers or anyone else thought of it, and carried on the same as before. But I was 19, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. And the people I was supposed to be able to trust for support instead decided to make me the poster child for their incipient zero-tolerance policy. I felt more exploited and mistrustful after that than I had by anything I'd experienced with the man they were supposedly ""protecting"" me from, and I‚Äôve stayed that way for a long, long time.

As for Jim ‚Äì he never looked at me or spoke to me again.

I can‚Äôt say I blame him.",10,0,meToo,khaleesi1968,1,2018-01-18 07:20:43

There was a small baseball field across the street from my house, and one day, there were people painting the bleachers. I was the kind of kid who wanted to be friends with everybody, so I went over and started talking to the guys while they were on a break. We were sitting in the dugout, and I made a comment about being tired and needing to take a nap. One of the guys made a comment about taking advantage of me while I was asleep.

When I was 13, I was really into video games. A guy I knew (who was around 30 years old), had a lot of games, and offered to let me play some of them on his new console. I went up to his apartment (I knew him for a few years, and up until this day, he never did or said anything creepy or inappropriate. He seemed like a nice guy), and while I was playing a game, he made a comment about me having nice breasts for a girl my age. I ignored him because I didn't know how to respond. Then he pulled me onto the bed, laid on his back, and put his head between my legs. I moved, and he pulled me back and put his head between my legs again, so I got up and started to leave. He pleaded with me to stay and said he wouldn't do it again, but I kept walking towards the door to leave. As I reached for the doorknob, he pulled me on top of him on the couch and tried to pull my pants down. I pushed his hands away and left.

When I was about 17, I was taking a woodworking class in high school. My teacher was in his 50s. One day, I asked him for help with one of the machines, and he said ""you just want an excuse to hold my hand"".

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I started out as a very innocent and sweet little girl and Tom boy who liked to play with legos and the boys however in my life experience as an asian woman I‚Äôve always been sexualized beyond my awareness at the time. 



Asian boys have targeted me and bullied me ever since elementary school, I was a deacons daughter and very sheltered and innocent like I flinched at bad words. This very ugly asian boy targeted me at school and constantly IM‚Äôd me on AIM and played weird manipulative beta incel games on me and would leave vulgar sexually explicit harassing jokes about what he‚Äôd like me to do to his balls when I was 11. 



He‚Äôs very ugly and has had a fixation on me all our lives and I wouldn‚Äôt even know him if he hadn‚Äôt constantly harassed me and fixated on me.



I also had an asian male therapist who was not very good at his job and I noticed now that asian men are incapable of seeing even patients as people if they look like young teen asian girls. I didn‚Äôt know how to talk about anything or the violent mental sexual and physical abuse my family forced on me and even during family therapy where they were attacking me and I broke down crying he just said I had a lot of power in the family and used our sessions to ask me about how far I‚Äôd been sexually and to describe my white boyfriends when I was a teen. Because of him he referred a scam abusive Mexican troubled teen program meant for gang members and murderers to my parents and I was forced there cut off all help and contact until I turned 18 and it has ruined my life and future.



When I was 15 a non Asian female caring therapist got me to open up about the abuse that just happened to me that week by my parents and she had an asian male social worker contact me. He went to my high school and loudly confronted me in front of popular kids and staff at my affluent white dominant high school and my family always beat me saying I had to protect their reputation and when he mentioned my parents would go to jail I was confused I cried and said I lied and my parents never touched me. He had this disgusting look of weird sexual frustration projection and hostility at me as I looked like a teen girl I guess which can only be sexualized by disgusting asian life ruiners and he yelled at me and told my parents to be hard on me since I was a spoiled brat who lied for attention. The female therapist was fired and I never spoke of the abuse again. Then I was sent to Mexico and tortured and deprived of my college plans.  



My life is ruined. Every step of the way asian males have sabotaged me and it‚Äôs a noticeable pattern I cannot deny any longer. There is a permeating disgusting enmeshment and perverted mansplain controlling attitude asian men have toward asian women.  My last therapist was a married asian male who groomed me despite me expressing I needed help to regain my self esteem and learn how to speak up for myself after Mexico and abuse by my family. He exploited me and my time over years, destroyed my relationship with the love of my life and assumed wrongly about him since he is white and forced me into hospitals and broke my hippaa violations and for no reason told me I would become a prostitute on skid row giving homeless men handjobs for crack. 


I am a deacons daughter, a Girl Scout with a silver medal and  grew up classier than he will ever know and I realize he was obsessed with me, stalked me, used my social media info to manipulate me and guilt me, shared too much I didn‚Äôt ask to know about his ugly old wife and marriage where he couldn‚Äôt get her pregnant and told me to masturbate and very explicitly told me how and to watch porn when I had not known about masturbation before. He is vindicative and months after I fired him and was doing well in school and working on fixing my life plans that were ruined almost a decade ago by the aftermath of Mexico, he worked behind my back to talk to my family and falsify police reports to put me in a hold and away from my dogs, he said I was lying about school when I expressed I needed to be free to go home and finish my finals. He delayed my education plans two years and I was able to transfer and prove I was right but a year later. 


He is a coward and when I asked for apology he made up lies and had a lawyer and personally threatened me by circumnavigating my email blocks to say if I left any reviews again on public websites he would show notes to authorities saying I was violent and insane and would press charges. My dog died in my arms after a year apart where he was neglected and abused by my family. I had him when I was 12 and he died when I was 24 and I couldn‚Äôt protect him. I just wanted an apology and I got a cowardly buttload of Blame and grief. 

My father always plays meek and mild but in private at home he has brutally attacked restrained and beat me. When u was a teen I tried to not engaged and just walk away into my room when he was yelling. He didn‚Äôt like that and walked in and grabbed my pony tail pulling it so I fell back hard on my back. When I tried to reason by talking he spit on my face so many times. I felt so disgusted and ashamed and powerless to even express this to anyone.  I still live with the scars he has sexualized me when u loved and looked up to him as my dad someone I wanted to be like, or who I thought he was. He insinuated when I was a teen to me that he has solicited prostitutes in Korea when he was younger and he was poor. I didn‚Äôt understand what he was trying to say until now and am mortified and he has no emotional intelligence to not understand the perverted things he has said to me disturbed me and was inappropriate.

He never let me out to socialize so I became an isolated hermit, he didn‚Äôt allow me to complete drivers ed and get my permit when I completed the training on my own and needed his permission. I had to teach myself to drive and get my license at 18 after Mexico. He never let me work for money I wanted to save up at 14 and work and could get a work permit if he signed it but he never allowed it and got angry when I asked. I wanted to work for money and also buy bday gifts for my best friends who gifted me well, I was embarrassed my family never let me buy them gifts of allowed me money and got angry and said the friends didn‚Äôt need gifts. They were jealous since my friends were white and good to me. People know me as an incompetent bum now. My life is over.


When I had my first bf at 16 I told my dad as it was a happy normal thing to share as I saw friends families were open and honest and supportive. My dad told me my body is his property. He and my mom stalked me if I was going to a friends house and soon my friends didn‚Äôt want me around because my parents followed us or staked outside their houses.



When I had a serious bf at 20 who happens to be white and shared a lot of same interests and traits to my very particular personality, my dad wouldn‚Äôt let me go out with him every week and asked if I thought he was better than my dad when all I did was excited ask for permission to go to Palm Springs.



I‚Äôm 26 now, my life plans and everything I ever hoped and worked for had been cut the fuck down before I could even get a head start, my relationship the only healthy happy love I‚Äôve experienced has been destroyed from inside out due to my toxic Asian family and dads inferiority complex. He didn‚Äôt understand- I loved him and my family and just wanted to share my happy life events with them and include them all. Asian men bring their bad reputation upon themselves. Asian men want me to kill myself as my entire youth and life has Been exploited and wasted by their selfish projections and toxic attitudes. I demand and ask that asian men as a whole seriously consider what they can work on in themselves before harassing and being sexually projecting and weird toward asian women. Their lack of working on themselves while thinking they have the right to abuse any asian girl they see has made this asian woman find them detestable.",9,0,meToo,7upt,1,2019-04-01 10:47:26
Scumbag Uncle accuses me of being a slut.,10,b01ob4,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b01ob4/scumbag_uncle_accuses_me_of_being_a_slut/,0,1552353630.0,"This is going to be the final story about my Scumbag Uncle (you know, the Entitled Conservative Parent who accused me of molesting his son and of being a satanist,) just because this is the story that makes me the MOST angry.

tl;dr, I have a traumatic experience and uncle thinks I sleep around after hearing about it.

So to start, this all happened when I was in my early 20's, like 22-ish. And unfortunately, my involvement was not direct in the aftermath, so there will be some he-said, she-said involved.

I went to a party my friend was throwing for her boyfriends birthday. There was drinking involved so I brought clothes to spend the night since we live in a rural area and taxi/uber fair would have killed me just as assuredly as driving while drunk would have.

While at this party there was a guy there who seemed fixated on me, he kept giving me drinks whenever he saw I didn't have one, etc. Until I got WAY too drunk. Fortunately I take after my mom where... alcohol does not affect my memory. No matter how drunk I get, I remember every detail of all the stupid shit I do. And this guy I mentioned? He didn't know that, so I think he intended for me not to remember that night, but I do.

Anyhoo, the party winds down and people start leaving and my friend and I start getting the couch ready for me to sleep on and I notice that guy not leaving. Turns out, he's come all the way from a city 2 1/2 hours out, and he's staying the night too. So, as soon as my friend and her boyfriend retire, he starts in on me, and I'm too drunk by this point to say no, and... yeah. That happened. :/

The reason I'm telling you this, dear reader, is because I want you to understand that what happened there, happened without my consent. This guy got me drunk so he could take advantage of my impaired judgement. This is NOT okay!

I woke the next morning in a lot of pain, both from the hangover and from *that.* I sobered myself up, went home, and attempted to forget about it, considering I never saw that man ever again.

Fast forward to a few months later. It's been 3 months since my last period and I start getting scared. That guy did not use a condom, and even though he pulled out, I didn't trust it... so I ask my Aunt for help. I felt ashamed and embarrassed, and I didn't want to confront my mom because she has a tendency to be a mama bear, (I'm her youngest so I've always been the ""baby"" even though I'm 29 now lol)

We end up staying out till 2am to get a pee test done and thankfully, all four came up negative. I get an earful from my mom the next day for not calling her to tell her I was going to be out all night, but it's better than being dragged to the police station only to be humiliated. I also got myself tested for STI's and that also came up negative. As far as I'm concerned, it's over, issue dropped, I can move on with my life. Right? Lol nope!

3 weeks later my mom and I were in the kitchen and she brings up the night of my friend's party. Cue this conversation:

Me: Why do you want to know?
My mom: Well, [scumbag uncle] called and told me you were sleeping around.
Me: *Mortified* What?! How would he know that?
Mom: [My aunt] had to tell him why she was out till 2am with you.

So apparently, what had happened was, this insecure toe rag had forced his wife to tell him where she was that night because otherwise, he auto-assumes she was out cheating on him (even though me and their daughter were with her.) So she told him the story I had told her about how I'd made a stupid mistake etc, because I didn't trust her to not tell my mom if she knew the truth.

This opinion this man has had of me ever since has been... pretty much disgusting. He auto assumes I'm a sexual deviant who wants to masturbate in front of his kids or some shit. I hate it, he ruins every interaction I have with my cousins because he throws that shade on me all the time and it feels like I can't relax and be friends with them. :/

There is a bit of good news, though. After being forced to tell my mom the whole truth, she didn't flip like I thought she would. She asked me if I wanted to go to the police about the incident, but by this time, my opinion on the matter was to just let it go. It's likely I would never see that man again, and I haven't, and even if I DID go to the police, the unfortunate truth is that they'd probably just laugh at me, since alcohol was involved and this happened well before the MeToo movement started.

It's been years since this incident and I'm well adjusted now, or as adjusted as one can be when my rapist is still out there, unpunished. It doesn't bother me as much anymore though, and I'm just glad I've never seen him since, and that he didn't leave a permanent mark on my life via child. Or disease. Believe me, if either one of those things had been the result, I would have chased him down into a jail cell.",10,0,meToo,OverTheMoon89,1,2019-03-12 04:20:30

A letter to my family.,9,aq0ncn,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aq0ncn/a_letter_to_my_family/,3,1550019139.0,"To the ones who hurt me. --Sometimes i am left laying in bed at night staring at the ceiling crying. Just trying to grasp your logic. When i was 9 my grandfather molested me. I've never called it that or written it out like that before this. I simply said ""my grandfather touched me in ways i wasn't comfortable with"" when having to explain. But that's what it is. That's what i will call it. You guys called it a ""misunderstanding."" This has stung like nothing else. He took away my childhood. From nine to thirteen. Maybe it doesn't sound like much. Only 4 years. But it's been left with me for so many years to follow. I finally broke down one day and told a friend over text-then call. Dad..you read all of those messages. You read the details. You learned the things he called me. You learned the things he did. You heard me crying struggling to breathe as i told you every detail from him calling me ""sexy"" at nine to waking up without pants on, at 3 am, with him in my bedroom, on my bed. You saw my face, you looked into my eyes, you heard my voice begging you to help. I was a ""daddy's girl"". I looked up to you. You promised to protect me. But you didn't. You said he was ""getting old and maybe he forgot what was appropriate."" You made so many excuses. Mom. He was your father, but i was your daughter. You told me ""he was only trying to be a loving grandfather."" I have such a hard time grasping how you chucked it up to that. I remember years before you telling me ""tell me if anyone ever makes your uncomfortable."" But when i did you shamed me. You told me i only wanted attention. And when i asked for therapy you laughed. Grandma. You meant so much to me. You were my mother figure, seeming that mom never cared much. You held me at night. You comforted my cries, you bandaged my scraped knees, you raised me. You truly knew me like no one else. So why would you think that i would lie about this? You told me that i ""hurt"" you by saying these things. You shunned me for months. But then tried to come back into my life with a text months later. Not apologizing. Not recognizing. But just asking how I've been. Then not understanding when i never messaged back. You meant the world to me...and then you left me. When i needed you the most, you were gone. I don't understand how you lay in the same bed as him at night knowing what he has done. You kiss him still. You hold his dirty hands. You still love him. And i don't understand how you can still look at him the same way. Sister. Maybe you were too young to understand. Our mother shouldn't have told you everything. You were only 7 or 8 when my mom told you these horrible things that i came out about. But then mom told you that i was lying. I can't be angry at you. But i don't want to sit down and tell you the things he did and said. And i'm not going to lie..It hurt when you said those words..""remember when you lied about grandpa doing of all those things."" I couldn't sleep that night. Grandpa. I get chills and watery eyes just writing this part to you-though you'll never read it. I don't like to think about you. I prefer to dwell on the hurtful words of my family. There's so much i want to say to you yet i don't want to say a thing. I get flashbacks almost everyday. Nightmares every night. It has been years and i can still feel your hands. I can feel your breath. I can hear your voice. I can smell cigarettes every time you come to mind. You send me stuff for holidays and i cry at the fact that you think of me. I can't touch the things you've sent to me. I don't want your money. I don't want your gifts. I want you to never say my name again. I can't see a grandfather with a happy grandchild without instantly panicking. How did you feel calling me ""Sexy"" when i came out of that room wearing a white t shirt? How did you feel when you asked me to drop my towel after i took a shower? Why did that ever feel right? How did you feel when you locked me into the truck a lone with you. I won't go into more detail. When you would buy me things afterwards to make me forget. There are foods that i can't eat anymore because of you. I throw up when someone unwraps a honey bun around me. Every time my little sister's utter your name i freeze. You didn't say anything when they told you. You let your wife defend you. You didn't look at me. I would like to say that you haven't ruined years for me. I would like to say that i have let this go and you don't affect me anymore. But i struggle with this everyday. To my family. You've made this so much harder for me to recover from. Everyone of your words stabbing me like knives. I want to be able to forgive you one day. But just typing this right now has left a knot in my stomach. I hope one day you can see this for what it is.

Fantasy-trafficking,9,apwhl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/apwhl5/fantasytrafficking/,9,1549996172.0,"My soon to be ex husband secretly spent our entire marriage of over a decade fantasy-trafficking me. He sent images (mostly explicit) of me out to men or posted the images or videos publicly and coordinated having them impregnate me, talking out all the details. In some of the images, I was underaged as we started dating young. Some of the men he talked to wanted to enslave our daughters as well. He never went through with it, but it was done completely without my knowledge or consent and was discussed with hundreds of men. 

He admitted to doing it. I have evidence that he did it. It's a felony in the state in which he did it.  And yet, I have been told that they will likely do nothing.  I will likely have to force my daughters to sleep at his house and spend time with him until they are adults because that's what good co-parents do.

Get Your Story Heard: Young documentary filmmakers is making a film about abuse and the #MeToo Movement,7,ankxts,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/ankxts/get_your_story_heard_young_documentary_filmmakers/,3,1549413975.0,"Hey there.

My friend and I are filmmakers in university from the UK. About a year ago, my friend was physically assaulted by a man she trusted, which was picked up clearly on CCTV, and over the past year I have seen her fight through fear, paranoia, frustration (due to lack of help from the police and our university) as she has had to stay in the same classroom as the bastard.

But now she's back fighting, and she is using her creativity and filmmaking skills to not only help herself through her trauma, but also to make a difference. She is making a documentary about abuse, especially cases which happened in university/college and how the school helped/didn't help the victims.

She has tried quite a few methods of getting people's stories, from posters to Facebook posts. She has even started a campaign called 'Talk Abuse Talk Awareness' (on Facebook, Tumblr and Instagram) to help spread awareness and to conquer misconceptions.

This documentary is not aimed at bringing in profit, but is aimed at bringing awareness. It is intended to be submitted into festivals to gain more audience. The more eyes that see it, the more awareness we spread. Also, this project is not for any of our university degrees. This is completely from my friend's own determination and drive.

She has asked me to ask around a few subreddits to see if anyone would like to anonymously share your stories. (Alternatively, you can be named, if you clearly request to be named; all unclear requests will be taken as anonymous for protection.) They can be ongoing or from decades ago.

If you have a story you want to share, then you can comment on this post, or privately email deadmayproductions@gmail.com. If you have any advice or suggestions for how we can find people open enough to talk about their stories, then please also comment or email with advice.

Thank you so much. I hope you are all having a good day.",7,0,meToo,StoryQueen97,1,2019-02-06 03:46:15

I feel insane.

Another story came out regarding sexual assault in Hollywood, the #metoo movement. My skin crawled with disgust as it was read and described to me. It‚Äôs hard to describe the feelings I personally feel when hearing these stories. I cover my breasts for no logical reason, but it‚Äôs the only thing that makes me feel safe. For some reason it brings me some comfort and protection. My mind starts to wander while processing the story. I imagine myself in their shoes. At the time it feels easy to disagree and argue various points. This feels almost natural it scares me. Questions start intensifying in my head like *is this real? How can this be real?* I blindly hope that it‚Äôs made up, even a little, and then maybe the world doesn‚Äôt look so evil. Maybe if it isn‚Äôt real then I don‚Äôt have to continue to cover my breasts and I can be a natural woman who can live in this world safely. Thoughts continue to follow like ‚Ä¶ *why would they wait so long?* Does that disqualify the victims somehow? I stop and evaluate my thoughts and feelings. Why am I so angry? This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Why does society have such a hold on me? Why is anger and skepticism so easy‚Ä¶natural? These comments and opinions seem to flow freely online that match mine. At the very least I take comfort in the fact I haven‚Äôt said them out loud. I am hurt by other people‚Äôs comments when I read or hear them. How does so much hate exist for victims? That‚Äôs what they are right? They didn‚Äôt ask for this. I am infuriated when hearing someone say, especially women, they were asking for it. How? Did they ask for it because of their clothing choice, or because of their *perceived* attitude? I feel so angry, but the atrocious thoughts leave my mind. How many times a day do I ‚Äúask for it‚Äù? I don‚Äôt want to be looked at yet in the same breathe I want attention and validation. Why? I don‚Äôt want to be treated as an object. Is that what it comes down to? These victims were treated as objects rather than people‚Ä¶ people with feelings, thoughts, and memories. What feeling could be worse than being made to feel like an object? An object that is disposable and in the grand scheme this object doesn‚Äôt matter. Who wants to feel like they don‚Äôt matter so much that they are abused? My heart hurts. My heart hurts when I feel their pain. I feel their pain easily, even though I don‚Äôt want to. My anger subsides and I feel shame and all I want to do is cry.

So it was a couple days before the Super Bowl of 2016. I was with an individual, let's call him A. Now I have been dating A for more then a month, and know him for longer. After my classes, A brought one of his gym buddies over at my dorm apartment after their workout session. Let's call the gym guy, V. Now I talked to the guy for about 20 minutes, and he seemed a bit weird. He seemed like the normal 6'4 jock, who only wanted to talk about his custom Mustang then he uses at rally races. After chatting for a bit, A and I moved into my bedroom just to hang out and talk about our day. V didn't follow, but he saw us go in and chat for a while. Eventually V left because he had something to do, but he saw A and I laying in bed together. I later get a Facebook notification and see that he requested to be my friend, and I accepted. We messaged each-other for the next day, but there was no flirting messages between each other because I'm monogamous.¬†

On the day of the Super Bowl, there was a party that the RA's were throwing in the dorm's main floor. I wasn't a social person, so I just stayed in my dorm living room in my PJs and V messaged me asking for me to let him in so he can go to the party (he loved off campus). I only knew him for 3 days, but I let him in the dorms. He thanked me and went to the party. After the game ended, he messaged me to ask if he could come to my dorm since he wanted to return a cup he borrowed for the party. I let him inside and we sat on the couch, on complete opposite sides. I was still in my PJs, which were long, and a regular shirt. I was on my computer writing up a report that I had for one of my classes. He kept talking to me, and my replied were ""uh huh"" because I wasn't paying attention to him. But I looked over and I could see him slowly move in my direction. I then saw the signs that he was interested in me, but I kept ignoring him because I wanted to get the report done. I put down my laptop because I wanted to get something to drink, and he grabbed my hand, and made me touch him. I said no and tried to pull away, but held on. He was bigger and stronger then me, and I was cornered on the couch. I'm a control freak over myself, and he took that control away from me. I said no two more times when he tried to kiss me, and he smiled at me and let my hand go. I didn't say anything else, and just ignored him for almost 5 minutes (I had a confidence issue, and I wasn't confrontational). So he left after and smiled at me saying ""I had a good time."" I broke down. I cried for hours, and I couldn't sleep that night. I messaged A, and he said that he didn't really know V that much, and he was just a gym buddy.

I stopped seeing A after this, because the event. He was about as non-confrontational as I was, and he didn't know what to do, so there wasn't any hard feelings hurt. After a couple of weeks, I had the courage to speak up, and told a couple of my friends. They said for me to go to the school and tell that what happened. I finally had the courage to do so a month after the incident.

I talked with two individuals from student affairs, and they wanted to start an investigation. I had to drive 50 mins to get to go talk to a private investigators about the incident. They took my report, and I was sent on my way. I told the individuals from student affair that the guy could be in one of my future classes, since it was a small university. They told me not to worry about it. I didn't hear back from the investigators for over 4 months. Then one day in my class, I got a call. They said that they are dropping the investigation due to a lack of evidence and an eye witness of the event. I was devastated and had to leave that class early. I told the student affairs about it, and they said that I should go read the report that the investigators made. So I drove 50 mins to go read the report, and I showed up only to have the receptionist let me see the report. V said that I did it on my own! I was dating and he said that I did it on my own will! That I said ""no, not now"" when he tried to kiss me. I was so angry, because it wasn't true. There was nothing I could do, and later that week, I received a message from V saying ""sorry, I didn't know you had a boyfriend."" I was also in a couple clubs, and guess who also showed up in both of those clubs and one of my classes.. V did. I don't know if he was stalking me, but I complained to the school about him showing up in my classes and clubs. They couldn't do anything about him showing up in the clubs, but they told him that he couldn't take that class, or take it online.

The school brought in a self defense instructor (he taught us Wing Chun), and he showed up on Tuesday and Thursdays evenings. I showed up on the Thursday class, and hop right into exercising with the guys. I impressed Sifu, and he was yelling out how a girl is gonna beat them in the running race. I then hear a voice say ""not me"" and guess who it was. It was V. He showed up the self defense class. I was livid for the rest of the session, and wanted to continue taking the self defense class. I talked with Sifu about how I was uncomfortable about V being there. He told me to come into the martial arts studio that he owned downtown. I got free sessions there for a month or so, then I switched to paying for the classes. I messaged A one night, and he said that he actually goes to the martial arts studio once in a while.

I continued to go to the studio and made many friends there. After a while, one of the guy friends asked if I wanted to go to the movies with him and his friend (let's call him J). I said yes, because I had my confidence built up, and I trusted him. I have been with J for over 2.5 years now and counting. I still chat with A, but we are only friends now. I still suffer from PTSD and go to a psychiatrist to help. I see the sexual assault as a good thing, because I never would of met the love of my life, J.

(Trigger warning: Sexual Assault) I need to get this out here.,8,9kytty,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9kytty/trigger_warning_sexual_assault_i_need_to_get_this/,2,1538549694.0,"   I just needed to get this off my chest. Where better than reddit amiright. My story is similar to Ford‚Äôs. It‚Äôs in bits and pieces because I was quite drunk but these are the parts I know for sure. I haven‚Äôt fully come out because I know that I‚Äôll get the same response I did when I told my story to an old friend of mine. That I shouldn‚Äôt have been drinking. That I should have known better. That it was somehow my fault. 
   I was at a party with 8 or 9 people. Me and one of the guys there were got the most drunk out of all of us. We were all having a blast and I thought that it was a safe enough environment, given that I was with friends and all, to be able to let go a little and have fun. 
   Later that night things started winding down and the 4 of us still away decided to put on the movie Heathers. 1 am rolls around and I‚Äôm texting some friends of mine. This guy that‚Äôs had a crush on me for a while texts me and asks me if I‚Äôm at said party. And if I‚Äôm drunk. I answered yes to both. About 20 minutes later he crept through the front door completely sober and energized while the rest of us are about to crash. He happened to be a friend of the party host so the host didn‚Äôt mind. The guy sat down awfully close to me. I entertained cuddling during the movie as I was quite drunk and didn‚Äôt think much of it. But once the other really drunk guy passed out on the floor and the party host‚Äôs girlfriend fell asleep on the couch the guy kept putting moves on me. He kept trying to kiss me and I kept saying ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm really drunk don‚Äôt.‚Äù He‚Äôd get all flustered and say stuff like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre killing me (name)‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt SEEM too drunk‚Äù and ‚Äúcmon please‚Äù. Every time I said no. 
   Eventually the party host wanted to go to bed so I asked him if he‚Äôd show me to the upstairs where I could sleep. After going upstairs to an attic like area, the guy didn‚Äôt follow so I‚Äôd figured he‚Äôd taken the hint and went home. Sure enough a few minutes later he quietly came up the stairs and jumped into bed with me. He kept trying to cuddle me and grope me and I continued to say ‚Äúno I‚Äôm drunk don‚Äôt‚Äù. It was almost 3 or 4 am by that time so he decided he had to head home if he was going to sneak into his house before his parents woke up. 
   This sounds absolutely terrible but. I‚Äôm glad that I only got out of there with attempted kisses and some groping. If he would have tried anything else... I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stop him. And in that attic space... I don‚Äôt think anyone would have heard me scream. ",8,0,meToo,bootayboy,1,2018-10-03 09:54:54

My story of harassment & stalking,8,8kyxnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8kyxnz/my_story_of_harassment_stalking/,5,1526886243.0,"Grab a snack and maybe a drink because this will be a long read. However, I will try my best to summarize for you guys.

When I was 12, my first bad memory of men got formed. I was threatened by a guy 2 years older than me that he would take care of me in the bathroom at school. At the time, I didn‚Äôt really know that he meant he would rape me since I was an actual child, but the older I got the more I realized what he meant by those words. However, a foul taste still was left in my mouth from that experience. 

When I was 14 (so a freshman), during a school trip my friends and I were approached by two boys. My girl friends fawned over them, but I really didn‚Äôt tbh. One of them was very weird around me. He would try to get close to me and brush against me. I constantly moved away and rejected his advances though... Later that night, when we were heading home on the bus, I got a few messages from that guy. How he got my number, I wasn‚Äôt sure. However I just thought it was whatever and texted him back normally. He was very kind to me and always polite... until maybe three weeks later? He began asking me my underwear color, bra size, if I was a virgin, and even more dirty questions. He even sent very unwanted pictures to me and tried to sext me. After maybe three or four more weeks of trying to pressure me to send something back, he snapped at me. Made me feel bad about myself and ended it with, ‚ÄúI hate innocent girls.‚Äù He made me feel that I was in the wrong; that I was the weird one. Like being ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô was a bad thing and everybody did those things except for me. And my ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù was that he stopped contacting me and I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since, but he added fuel to the fire that had been set a couple years back. 

The next one happened when I was freshly 17 and had been working at my new job for a couple of months (it was now early November, I started it in July). I started having weird feelings or being watched or followed. I would see this same truck parked close to my car and also the same man once in awhile. For weeks this continued... until one day when I worked a morning shift, I saw this man just sit down at a table and order nothing. Occasionally I‚Äôd see him stare at me but I thought nothing of it as I was too busy in my work. After maybe a week of that happening every day to me, he finally came up to ‚Äúorder‚Äù something‚Äî or so I thought. He just stood there until I finally asked him, ‚Äúdo you want to order something sir?‚Äù He froze for a second and said ‚Äúoh- uh, no.‚Äù And he walked closer to me, leaned in and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to go on a date with you after work.‚Äù I chuckled out of PURE awkwardness because that‚Äôs just what I do and he snapped at me saying ‚Äúis it really that funny??‚Äù I flinched by the look in his eyes and quickly said back ‚Äúno no, uh- uhm. How old are you?‚Äù (i asked because he clearly looked in his late twenties) and he said ‚Äú26.‚Äù I responded back by saying ‚ÄúWell, I am 17.‚Äù  His response sent shivers down my spine, ‚Äúso?‚Äù it echoed in my mind. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond to that, so I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sir, but I need to refill the coffee.‚Äù And he quickly left after that; he BOLTED. Afterwards, I began seeing him still. This time I was on a register and he bought something then asked, ‚Äúyou get off at one, right?‚Äù And I was shocked. ‚ÄúHow tf does he know my schedule‚Äù I thought. But I played it off by just being like, ‚Äúuh, yeah.‚Äù Then the next morning, around 5:40 AM because I worked another 6AM shift, I was walking out to my car when I felt like I was being watched. Ignoring that, I got in my car and as I drove to the stop sign, a huge truck turned on their lights & engine and pulled up behind me and started tailgating me all the way to my work. So, I just didn‚Äôt park. I kept driving and they KEPT following until after maybe 5-6 more minutes and then they finally stopped and I went to work. 

Things still haven‚Äôt been the same. I still feel watched occasionally and get weird feelings. I‚Äôm also terrified of guys, I flinch, shy away, etc. mostly from older guys though, not so much younger ones. I just thought to share my story. I need to tell someone.

My mom always wondered why I was so scared to go to school everyday in kindergarten and, at the time, I didn't know why I was terrified of going either. It wasn't until recently that I finally allowed what happened to me every day of kindergarten to come to my knowledge. I was assigned to sit next to this boy, Im not using his name, that would slide his hand up my dress and shoved his fingers up my vagina every god damn day. At the time I didn't understand that it was wrong for him to do that to me, and my teachers overlooking it certainly aided in that mindset as well. My mom was really concerned because I would one home every day with blood spotting my urine. I still have never told her this.

***My Reputation Ruined***

During the summer before my freshman year of high school I met a boy that I'll call for the sake of privacy Justin. I met him online and had finally got the courage to meet him in person. The same day I met him he gave me my first kiss. Along with other unwanted firsts. After we kissed he said he wanted to hang out on the boat a while so I agreed. When we got seated he then proceeded to slip his hands down my bathing suit bottoms and began fingering me. I was so embarrassed and scared that I let it happen. The main thing I can vividly remember while this was going on was wishing I had never agreed to go to his house. He then took me to his guest bedroom and told me he wanted me to suck his dick. I just had my first kiss so I didn't know what to do. I tried trying to kiss him to distract him to no avail. He began to push my head toward his crouch when my mouth was finally touching the tip of his dick. He preceded to shove it in and began a back and forth motion. He told me he was ""teaching"" me how to do it. I then felt the sudden eruption of warm salty juice in the back of my throat and wanted to vomit. But I didn't. I just walked out of his house and went home, pretending as if nothing had happened. Of course he had gotten what he wanted so he never spoke to me again after that.

***Stupid Girl***

One night a few moths after the previous entry, a boy texted me and said he wanted to hang out. I agreed and he and his friend picked up me and a couple of my friends. He then parked and his friend got out of the car and told my friends to go with him, so they did. When me and the boy were alone in the car he said he wanted me to suck his dick. I said no and thats when he pulled my head to his and began kissing me. He then forced my head down onto his dick and moved it up and down, until he came. The whole time the only thing I was worried about was him seeing me silently crying while he thrust my head up and down. My friends got in the car shortly afterwards and I pretended as if everything was fine, like I always do.

***The Pills***

A year after the previous incident, it was the night of a famous dance in my town that everyone goes to. It is basically an excuse to get fucked up and dance with cute guys. I started drinking before the party and when I got there, I just stood in the corner ready to leave. None of the guys I liked wanted to dance with me. After the dance me and some friends went to a bonfire where this guy I thought was cute was at. He came up to me, I was drunk at this point, and offered me a couple of pills. Pills that I later found out to be Xanax bars. So I took them and the rest of the night was foggy. All I remember is walking up my front porch at 4am with some guys sweatpants on and my mom snatching my phone. The next day my sister came in my room and told me that the guy that gave me the Xanax had sent a video of me sucking his dick to all of his friends, who just so happened to be the most ""popular"", and meanest, people in my town. Not to mention I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business. I don't even remember that happening. I haven't had the strength to look at the video and do not think I ever will. After that I continuously got harassed. People egged my car, threw milkshakes on my car, wrote hurtful words on my car with paint, said hateful things about me on every social media site available. And I thought it was the end for me.

I'm still trying to stay strong and I know my story/stories aren't even as close to as bad as other people but I just hope it will let people know they aren't alone.

Under [the old definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20180405013124/https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault), 

> Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

Under the [new definition](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault):

> The term ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.

Most state laws were less stringent than the old definition of sexual assault. For example, [here](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/compare.cfm)'s a comparison of the legal definition of consent in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Montana. 

According to [RAINN's database](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/), only 8 states require ""affirmative or freely given consent."" Those states are Florida, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Washington, New Jersey, Illinois, and California. ",10,0,meToo,ILikeNeurons,0,2018-04-20 04:56:01

He called me in from playing outside he said I didn't finish my chores so I was in trouble. I walked in and he locked the door behind me.He then told me to go do the counters. When I was finished he told me to sit next to him. He had a blanket on his lap. When I sat next to him he put his hand out right before I sat down so it would land right between my thighs. I didn't know what to say so I just let it happen he started to rub my thighs and then my private. He grabbed my hand and put lotion on it he told me to go up and down and squeeze so I did every time I stopped he would yell at me. I knew this was wrong but I said nothing he finished and told me to go wash my hands and that this would be our secret and if I told any one that he would be very upset.This happend ever day for about 6 months until he wanted more.

I cried through the whole thing thinking he would stop but he didn't he finished in a glass and told me to drink it when I refused he smacked me so I did I threw up the whole day after that.

I [M] feel like exploding,9,82fd0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/82fd0k/i_m_feel_like_exploding/,3,1520345807.0,"Hi you all,

I don't know how long this post will be or where it will go. I'll surely speak about secrets I've never told anyone, but I feel the need to speak them out because I can't keep them to myself.

So, first off, I was really triggered about what happened to Matt Damon for speaking what seems to be a very reasonable opinion.

For context: I am a 33 yo Moroccan Muslim man. Yes, our society is machist but more open than, let's say the Middle-East, and many reforms are making their way into society. Even though the reach of the MeToo movement is limited here, its excess scares me as I see what happens elsewhere as a prediction of what will happen in my country.

Many call me a feminist (some use it even as an insult, but they are rare) and I am proud of being a feminist.

My father was supportive of our mother, he listened to her opinions and ideas, he cooked, cleaned the dishes, participated actively in our education and taught us to judge people by their actions regardless of gender, color, religion or anything else. He has his flaws but he is a just man.

In this context, I grew to be insensitive to gender roles as defined by society and was kind of tone deaf to societal expectations and I never minded because my attitude gave me some of the best friendships and experiences I could ask for.

It was hard at times to vehemently speak up against misogynistic behavior and deconstructing again and again many misconceptions but I never complained. Seeing comptent women advance fills me with pride and joy (the same goes for any opressed group really).

I normally should be able to rise above the extreme views of some people but I can't. Here is why:

- I just got out of a very tiering marriage with an abusive wife. I had to settle for a bad deal because ""you won't convince any judge. They'll laugh at you hard"" (my lawyer) and it happened to other men.

- I got the ""all men are stupid/pigs/..."" message far too often augmented with the ""you're just like them"" when and if I try discuss this board generalization.

- I saw some women cherry pick the rules that favor them for each situation.

- I woman assaulted a man because ""he looked at me funny"" while in fact he was oogling a car at a dealership. Since I witnessed all of it, Itried to dissipate the misunderstanding just to be verbally assaulted.

- The memory of being sexually exploited by my 16 yo old nany when I was 6 to remove her sexual frustration resurfaced hard. I can't yet tell myself that I was assaulted.

Having women feel safe in their private and public lives is essential and benefits us all and I stand solidly behind it. More should be done and berating all males isn't one of them.

Saying ""our movement does not stand for this or that"" doesn't bear much weight when its majority doesn't stand against their extremists. I know what I'm talking about since I'm a Muslim: my words about ""Islam is a religion of peace"" will always sound hollow as long as I do not fight extremists in my religion.

I am in a position where I don't feel safe, because if a woman wrongly attacks me (1) most men will say ""serves you right for defending such wicked creatures"", (2) most women will stay silent or say ""sacrificing some men for the greater good is unavoidable"" and (3) my career will surely take a hit.

In the end, I think I'll do as Matt did: I'll cave in an shut up. I have too much to lose.",9,0,meToo,bladexp210,1,2018-03-06 17:16:47

Should I come forward against my abuser?,8,awrbyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/awrbyd/should_i_come_forward_against_my_abuser/,9,1551593908.0,"About 15 years ago I was doing a lot of amateur theatre.  And during one particular production there was a choreographer/performer who would grope and assault me pretty much every night.

I was just a ""chorus singer"" but there was one specific part during the show where I had to stand just offstage and help to hold a part of the set for ""reasons"".  I had to hold a certain piece above my head, and be ready to help support the weight of an actor, so I had to remain frozen and ""anchored"".

She also had a stage entrance to make from where I stood.  So as she would get ready to go onstage, she would rub herself against me (bum against crotch) and put her hands on me, rub me and fondle me, and sometimes kiss my neck. Then she would go onstage.  She did this every night for the run of the show.

She enjoyed the fact that I couldnt do anything or react, because I had to stay where I was and hold the set. I was ""trapped"". She thought this was funny.

I *didn't* like this. We had no private relationship with each other and there had been no flirting or whatever from my side ever.  But I didnt know what to do since she was very important to the production and a ""senior figure"" in the theatre scene. So I never said anything to anyone, and just endured it.  Eventually the show ended. I moved away from that town.

But here I am 15 years later moving back to help take care of my family.  She still lives here, except now she is in her 50s and at the edge of being a somewhat successful film/tv producer. She has worked on TV projects and has just released her first indie film project, which seems to be having some success.

The film itself touches the theme of sexual abuse. And she is becoming/has become somewhat of a local celebrity, and is making all of these appearances and speeches and interviews talking about the subject. Even referencing #metoo.

It is very hard for me to see her do this, knowing what she did to me.

So .. should I come forward that she actually sexually assaulted me?  I dont want to seem petty, but it makes me furious to see her ""cash in"" on this topic, knowing what she has done.",8,0,meToo,Tychonaut,1,2019-03-03 09:18:28

One friend got very drunk and passed out on the floor while I was sitting on the sofa nearby. I'm a small gay woman and he's a very large bisexual man, fwiw. He is usually very kind to women. He awoke from his drunkenness, and grabbed my dress at my breast trying to pull me down onto the floor in front of 2 friends. It seemed he was jealous that I was speaking to another man. I pushed his hand away and said no, but he continued to pull my dress and me down towards him until it ripped and I yelled and pushed him hard. It lasted 1 minute maybe. Now today, I just confronted him in front of another woman. He claims to not remember anything and is begging for me to forget about it too. Which I could after some time, but he's also asking not to tell our friends what happened, and that bothers me more. He said it was wrong to mention it in front of his female friend today and that I shouldn't tell other people either.

 I said that I didn't want to see him for a while until he was sober bc of his actions.  Because despite knowing him well, in that brief moment I felt very threatened. He asked the other guy and girl what he did to me, and they said it didn't seem like a big deal to them. But when I walked home with a torn dress last night I felt very assaulted.

I started as a hostess and have been recently brought up to bartending at the establishment I currently work at. But never have I had an incident like what I experienced today.

I was greeter hostess at work today, which essentially means I would say hello to guests and put them on the waitlist (if applicable). Before the dinner rush began, I had a table of 5 come in and as I was opening a server to take them, one gentleman was acting quite weird. He asked about his (male) server and if he was the only one taking care of them, to which I said yes. Their server came to seat them and joked about bringing them to the ""VIP Table"" to which this gentleman attempted to make a joke by asking ""What does VIP mean?"" (I really don't know how he thought he was funny).

An hour or so passes and we're in the middle of a dinner rush. I have party after party coming in to get their name on the waitlist. I have a short intermission between guests when this gentleman comes up behind me, pushes his body against  mine and whispers in my ear ""the service was so good, I guess we'll have to come again."" He laughs and exits the restaurant before I'm able to get out of my customer service mindset and into the Holy-Shit-I-Just-Got-Assaulted mindset. But people are coming in so I continue to do my job until the next opportunity to head into the changeroom and cry.

Has anyone else pressed charges successfully? This is my victim impact statement from my rapist's sentencing.,9,aczjvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aczjvs/has_anyone_else_pressed_charges_successfully_this/,1,1546730327.0,"I chatted with a man briefly at a bar one night, and he followed me in the dark on my walk home (unbeknownst to me) and waited outside my home for an hour, waiting for me to fall asleep. He broke into my home and I woke up to him assaulting me. I called the police, followed through with the legal process, and started a wild wave of processing and emotions. Here is my impact statement, reflecting the place I was in during his sentencing. The roller coaster of emotions has continued since. Comment and tell me about your Journey‚ô°.

Good morning, Your Honor,

First, I would like to thank the public servants that have supported me during this process. Your professionalism, compassion, and dedication has made this as smooth a process as possible. I have shared my praise with those close to me, and everyone is thankful and supportive of your efforts.

Rape is a terrifying violation. I feel lucky to live in an age and society where its severity is recognized, and where avenues exist to preserve justice.

Losing control of my body and having my most intimate boundaries violated shook me to the core and left me stunned. I was of a zombie for the weeks after, breaking into tears often, or hysterical laughing spells. The few short terrible minutes lived on, and the trauma did not stop there.

7 hours being poked and prodded and questioned at the emergency room. I felt dirty for weeks, and couldn‚Äôt seem to take enough showers. Weeks on the phone and visiting the offices of detectives, having to relive my story over and over, and even confront my perpetrator.

My sacred retreat that is my camper van (and home) will forever carry the memory of the attack. I‚Äôve often awoken in the van, alone or beside a loved one, and had to relive the event in my mind. My van was new, the first place I‚Äôve ever ‚Äúowned,‚Äù and a welcome refuge during a terrible couple years of tumultuous life events. I was in a rut, and this incident tainted one of my precious escapes.

I‚Äôve now found myself more suspicious of strangers, and fearful for my own safety in public. I am more defensive and standoffish around men, a dynamic I loath. Sex itself is poisoned. Relationships are more complicated as I carry my trauma. 

When my perpetrator was written up in the local news outlets, I witnessed a disturbing smear of hateful language on the comment sections. Attacking him, and discrediting me: sexist, racist, and violent words that left me in tears. Since, a bitter taste about our current political situation, and our electorate at large, has tinged my perspective.

Probably the most unwelcome feeling is that of guilt. Not for the rape-- ¬†that was on you, (name - privacy protected). But for the consequences of doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù and following up: putting a man behind bars and causing his loved ones to suffer immensely. The three years in prison, or the potential 30 I was imagining, will no doubt be difficult for you, and could break a weak man. I have to believe that you are strong enough to overcome this, and that somewhere in the process you will seize the opportunities for healing and growth. I won‚Äôt feel bad that you're facing these consequences, but I will pray that the justice system will do its job for all including you, (name). The most important thing is to ensure events like these don‚Äôt happen.

Statistics say that three rapes out of one hundred end in a successful conviction. This is atrocious, since this is one of the most important dangers from which to protect our citizens. When I spoke out, I hoped I was helping to speak out for the countless other victims of sexual violence that haven‚Äôt yet tasted justice.

I do want to offer what I can to help everyone in this healing process. Now, I would like to address (name) directly:

*This section in Spanish, translation follows*

(Name), recib√≠ tu carta. Es imposible tratar entender tus acciones o motivos para la violaci√≥n, aun m√°s cuando le√≠ tu disculpa. Me pareci√≥ sincero. ¬†Para mi, esto significa que entend√≠as tus errores. Sab√≠as lo que era correcto.

Me lastimaste. Te ofreci mi amistad y compa√±√≠a, y me enganaste y violaste.

Y como dije, y explicaste en tu carta, sab√≠as mejor. Vi el arrepentimiento en tu cara esta misma noche, y lo escuche por telefono. Lo lei en tu carta, y lo siento en mis sue√±os. Todo que conozco de ti, de tu tiempo en el mercado, y tu gran comunidad de amigos y familia, es que eres un hombre carism√°tico, inteligente, cari√±oso, y querido. C√≥mo llegaste en esta situaci√≥n es dif√≠cil entender, quizas aun mas para ti. Pero supiste mejor. Sabes c√≥mo se debe tratar a los dem√°s. Sabes hacerlo, y lo puedes hacer. Yo lo s√© de coraz√≥n, y por eso te perdono. Por favor escucha mis palabras, porque espero que te sirvan con tu curaci√≥n y que puedas crecer a ser el hombre que quieres ser. Te perdono.

Odio el evento de la violaci√≥n, pero no te odio a ti. En realidad, te espero todo lo mejor en esta vida. All I want is to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen again. ¬†

En realidad, lo m√°s dif√≠cil ha sido intentar empatizar contigo, entender de d√≥nde vienes, o lo que enfrentas hoy. He pasado horas ponderando tus decisiones aquel noche, o lo que est√°s haciendo o pensando en cualquier momento. Pienso en tu familia.

Aunque no conozco un dios espec√≠fico, he estado rezando por ti. Rezo que encuentres fortaleza, compa√±erismo, y momentos de paz para refleccionar durante estes dias dificiles. Te espero seguridad, salud, y amistad en la c√°rcel. Ojala que puedas aprovechar las oportunidades que hay, y madurar a trav√©s de educacion, refleccion, y apoyo de compa√±eros y profesionales. Espero que despu√©s de cumplir tu castigo, reintegras r√°pido a la sociedad y sigues con una vida feliz.

Y tengo un deseo m√°s, y lo voy a explicar en ingl√©s. 



*Translation of Spanish section*

(Name), I received your letter. It is impossible to understand your actions or motives for the rape, even more after reading your apology. You knew better. 

You hurt me. I offered you my friendship and companionship, and you betrayed me and raped me.

And as I said, and you explained in your letter, you knew better. I saw the regret on your face, and I heard it over the phone. I read it in your letter, and I feel it in my dreams. Everything I know about you, from your time at the market, to your large community of family and friends, is that you are an intelligent, charismatic, caring, and loved person. How you got yourself into this situation is hard to understand, perhaps even more so for you. But you knew better. You know better, and you can do better. And for this reason, I forgive you. Please listen to my words, so that they might help you in your healing. I forgive you.

I hate the event of the rape, but I don't hate you. In reality, I want the best for you in this life. All I want is to ensure this doesn't happen again. 

The most difficult has been trying to empathize with you. Understand where you are coming from, or what you are thinking or doing at any moment. I think about your family.

Although I don't know a specific god, I pray for you. I pray that you find strength, companionship, and moments of peace to reflect in these difficult days. I wish safety, health, and friendship for you in jail. I hope you can take advantage of the opportunities there are, and mature through education, reflection, and the support of companions and professionals. I hope that after finishing your punishment, you reintegrate quickly into society and continue with a happy life.

*translation complete*

I hope that everyone involved in this disturbing crime, can grasp onto something positive from the experience and march forward. This process has disturbed many lives, but hopefully also shown the strength of supportive family and friend circles. I know in my case, a positive experience with the professionals in the system has left me optimistic and appreciative. Perhaps the most important opportunity, is for us all to learn what we can to ensure these acts of violence cease to happen. That will take all of us, educating and supporting current and potential, victims and perpetrators, to get the help they need. (Name), you and I especially carry this responsibility. I have faith you will grow and mature from this experience, and I hope that you are able to share that wisdom and help other young men make safe, responsible decisions. Consent, consent, consent. I too, commit to sharing my experience with people of all ages, hoping they might understand healthy sexual boundaries. 

Thank you, everyone, for hearing my words. May peace come to us all.

Anyway, last week I was on the phone with my FP and out of nowhere I just like remembered being molested as a child. I had really vivid flashbacks of being with that family member and all the things she would do to me. I felt really confused because it didn't feel real and I started feeling uncomfortable. I talked to my counselor about it and she said it was completely normal for something like that to be erased from my memory especially because it happened at such a young age. I only started recently talking to that side of the family within the past year because my dad passed away and I had negatives feeling towards my cousin but I couldn't really explain why but now it makes sense why. I don't really know what kind of response I'm looking for- maybe just if anyone can relate to the blacking out a memory entirely until something brings it back up into your mind.

One night I stayed at his and he quite agressively held me. I felt claustraphobic but thought nothing of and slowly drifted off, this when i woke up to him stroking my crotch to which i politely told him too back off (he knew I was straight) which he did and then a few hours later I woke p to him masturbating over me, and once he finished he wiped himself off and then resumed spooning me very tightly. Now at work I really struggle to concentrate and fell quite ill around him, while he just gets very comfortable around me, pecks me on my neck while I'm working etc

I've never felt like my experienced mattered in the #metoo world.

I was maybe 11 at summer church camp with my grandma and sister. I had several girlfriends there, including my older cousin, and loved hanging out with them. One day out of the blue, my cousin, spurred on by the rest of the group, told me I had to sit with a girl I wasn't fond of at dinner or wear a bra. I told them I wasn't interested in either but they weren't having it. When I insisted they drop it, they shoved me into the bathroom, turned off the lights, locked the door and forced my shirt off so they could put a bra on me. I remember yelling and crying for them to stop. I eventually called them perverts and they turned on the lights and left. When my grandma found me crying in the bathroom later she told me to 'let bygones be bygones, it was my cousin after all.' 

I've shrugged off this experience for a long time but I am questioning how much of an effect it really had on me... assault stories trigger me so much but I've always chalked that up to being a woman who can empathize with other women. But I never felt like I fit in with other women who had been assaulted by men. Certainly if this story featured boys there would not be a doubt in my mind. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience? I would love to hear from you.",8,0,meToo,,1,2018-10-11 02:30:43

"My boyfriend sexually and emotionally abused me for a year, went to the police and they did nothing.",9,9jy3lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9jy3lj/my_boyfriend_sexually_and_emotionally_abused_me/,9,1538237114.0,"So kinda a long story, I will try not to ramble.

I dated a guy for two years, we both were way into drugs . I was trying to clean up my life and about a year into the relationship things started to sour. He became emotionally abusive, controlling, gaslighting, insulting, you name it. That's when he also stopped having sex with me, and then every time we had a fight and he would be drunk/ high he would wait until I was asleep and force himself on me.

It took me a full year to get clean. We worked together ( bad idea) and he would often use me to cover his shifts when he was too hungover. He eventually almost got fired for this and I took the opportunity to quit and find a job elsewhere.

During that year of struggling to get clean I tried to break up with him several times, my name was on the lease but he would never leave. I was too broke to find another apartment on my own and I couldn't find a roommate that would allow me to have my two dogs. I felt stuck.

He HATED the fact that I had a new job and that I wasn't working with him. In retrospect I now see that it's because he felt he couldn't control me. At my new job I met and fell in love with my now husband.  He was aware of the situation ( minus the sexual abuse) and was supportive of me, and of course encouraged me to move out.

One night I came home after work ( I worked nights so around 2am as I had gone for a late night dinner with some friends and my now husband). I tried to stay out as late as I could ( to avoid the ex boyfriend) and truthfully only came home to make sure the dogs were taken care of and so that I could walk them the next morning before work.

He had been using cocaine all night and was pretty wrecked by the time I got home. I went straight to bed as I did not want to talk to him. He then forced himself on me. I didn't fight back because in the past he would just over power me anyway. He also was about 100 lbs bigger than me and coked out, so not someone I could win a fight with. I don't have that fight or fight instinct naturally, I freeze for the most part. I was crying the whole time and had finally had enough. I had made up my mind that I was going to call my landlord and break my lease, and get the fuck out.

The next day my husband took one look at me and knew something had happened. I told him and he immediately called my best friend to come pick me up, get my dogs and things to stay with her. He then insisted I call the police.

I called the police and they came to my friend's place and I told them everything.

They became fixated  that I hadn't tried to physically fight him off. I tried to explain to them that this behaviour had been going on for an entire year and that resisting only made it worse.They also became fixated  that I had a new boyfriend that I had spent time with earlier that night. 

They told me that because I hadn't screamed or put up a fight that there wasn't anything they could do other than interview him, and be present to get my things. He had a criminal record as well and was known to them ( the latest charge was for assualting his exwife which I still kick myself for because I knew all about it, but I was on drugs and literally had zero self esteem). They also made me feel bad that I had froze instead of fighting him off. 

You would think that police officers working in a sex crime unit would have seen it all, and known sometimes people freeze. I felt beyond judged and humiliated telling my story and ultimately the impression from them that I was wasting their time. They seemingly were writing this up as just a fucked up love triangle.

My entire life I had always been trusting of the police. I had no reason not to believe that if I needed help, that they would be there. That they would do their jobs, and be impartial/ fair. I no longer believe that.

I have been so angry about this for years ( this happened about 5 years ago). I have been in counselling for 10 months after being diagnosed with PTSD. It has been tremendously helpful and worth all the time and money invested.

Sorry for such a long post. Even if this doesn't get read I feel so much better just putting this out there.

Oh also as a side note, I spoil the fuck out of my dog ( only have one now and she is turning 10 soon). I know I can't take back those two years where I was a terrible Dog Mom, but I sure as hell can ensure she is now living her best life.",9,0,meToo,ItsmeClemFandango,1,2018-09-29 19:05:14

So much so that much of my life I don‚Äôt remember. I‚Äôve had to have my family and my boyfriend tell me things that I did and I just have to believe them. My family would always brush it off as ‚Äú oh he‚Äôs that way with everyone! He‚Äôs just very touchy.‚Äù As I got older and expressed my discomfort around him to my mom, she would just say ‚Äú he misses you that‚Äôs all. We only get to see them a couple of times a year so when he‚Äôs here make sure you spend time with him.‚Äù I remember when him and my aunt would come over, they would sleep in my sisters room and she would go sleep in my parents. I was in high school then, and my sister and I had a bathroom that connected our rooms. I would open my closet door and use a scarf to tie the doorknobs together, and wet the bed at 15 years old because I was too scared to risk running into him. Many things I have forced myself not to remember, but they come back in waves. I was 21 years old, standing next to my mom in the kitchen and he comes up to me, rubs my breast and looks into my eyes and asks ‚Äú does that tickle?‚Äù I just froze, I couldn‚Äôt move. I remember thinking ‚Äú how does she not see this?! I was barely a foot away from my mom. He had gotten so comfortable being as though he‚Äôs been able to get away with it my whole life, that he touched me right in front of my mom. Not long after that, I broke up with my long time boyfriend and started sleeping around with random guys that I had met at work. One guy, he was 10 years older than me, had his own house. I would lie to my parents saying that I was going to a friends house and instead go to his to hook up. One night, I was on my way to his house and I called my mom and told her everything. Now this wasn‚Äôt the first time I told her, I‚Äôve been telling her for years that he made me uncomfortable but she just kept brushing it off. He was set to come over the next day, so I called her and told her everything on the way to this guys house, I was crying and yelling at my mom, saying that she can‚Äôt keep sticking up for him, that he‚Äôs been doing this to me my whole life and it has ruined all of my relationships, it‚Äôs the reason I am suicidal and have been for years. Fast forward a couple of days later, I was in my room, my brothers birthday actually, and I called my mom crying because I didn‚Äôt want to live anymore. All I ever thought about was the different ways I could do it. I had already stopped eating, relied on my Xanax to sleep at night and even then that was a joke, I couldn‚Äôt sleep because everything in my room reminded me of the things he had done to me in there. I didn‚Äôt feel safe anywhere. This whole house. Every house. Everything of mine made me think of it. So, she had me go to the hospital and she met me there. God I remember how embarrassing it was to have to go in and tell all the nurses and doctors that I was suicidal. All of the attention I got and how everyone was rushing around and treating me like I was, well, suicidal. No sharp objects or anything around me that can be used to harm myself. I was in that hospital for hours, I was right across from this big glass room full of nurses watching my every move, it was so uncomfortable. My sister had gotten off of work and came straight over, and she was freaking out asking me what I had done and I had to tell her nothing, and explain why I was in there. She then told me that he had done the same thing to her, and I lost it, I wanted to get out of there and go kill him. 
Skipping ahead a bit, early that morning around 2 am I was sent off to a rehab center. I didn‚Äôt have any personal items, just a hospital gown and a thin blanket. The rehab center was tailored towards drug addicts and alcoholics. It was the worst experience I have ever had. One guy was 19 and had gotten high on some drug and was driving his car while carving his arm. I was the only one there for my situation, and one day during group the moderator asked if anyone was to blame for us being there, and then said ‚Äú you are here because of choices you made.‚Äù I wanted to say so badly ‚Äú okay so it was my choice to be molested? Oh yeah because a little girl is asking for it right?‚Äù The only reason why I didn‚Äôt was because I was trying so hard to be good so I could leave. When all I needed was to have some control over what happens to me, I go to this place where I have absolutely no control. The only person in a hospital gown, with all our doors open, having mandatory group sessions and being forced to take medications. They kept saying ‚Äú you can leave tomorrow‚Äù, every time I would speak to a doctor that‚Äôs what they would say but I was there for a whole week. Every time I went to the doctor I had to lie and say I was doing great, feeling great, just saying whatever they wanted to hear so I could leave. I‚Äôm sure those places do help people, but that place made me more suicidal then when I went in. All they preached was that we are there because we made bad choices, we were at fault and the cause for us being in our situations.
A couple of months after all of that, I had enough strength to go to the police, write a report, tell my whole family, and all of my coworkers. After everything I did, all the police did was blame the other counties ( it happened in 2 states and 3 counties) then say that because there is no PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, there is nothing they can do. So I‚Äôm left with PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks, can‚Äôt even be touched by my boyfriend, or when he does I scream and cry. 
My mom called him and confronted him about it and he just denied it. He turned our Aunt against us, who is my Dad‚Äôs sister, because it‚Äôs easier to live with a liar and child molester and deny it then face us.
Now, my parents say to just forget about it and try and move on. But how can I when I know he knows where I live?

I was sexually harassed by a high-ranking man at an organization I volunteered for,8,8veizq,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8veizq/i_was_sexually_harassed_by_a_highranking_man_at/,2,1530492376.0,"[https://imgur.com/a/nuvFsTU](https://imgur.com/a/nuvFsTU)

I put up with it for as long as I did (almost 2 months) because he appeared to have a lot of power and was considered for many top positions including leader, vice-chairman, secretary, member-at-large, and ethics committee. When I first complained about sexual harassment but before I showed screenshots some responses I got were ""Ugh are you sure he is being seriously and not just teasing?"" and "" we \[...\] are now witnessing trolls and moles as well as saboteurs from other \[organizations\] trying to destroy our\[s\]"" so I was not considered the most credible considering I was rather new. The organization is mainly made up of older white men and I am a rare young woman of colour, being of Chinese origin. He was banned from associating with us once I revealed my screenshots. I have also contacted police because he appeared to have pedophilic tendencies based on these chats, which the officer agreed with. I do not know what further action could be taken legally though, as blocking him was suffice in stopping the communication. He was just as creepy in person as he was online. 7 women including me claim he harassed them in some way. I'm publicizing his chats on Facebook and get told I'm beating a dead horse.

\- Told me he was going to ""poke my tongue in and out your ass hole then as deep as it will go curling and tapping inside you mmmmmm.""

\- Claimed to be 43, then 40. He has white hair and I suspect he's at least 53. When I told him I'm 24 he told me I'm supposedly spiritually 40, whatever that means.

Seeing accounts of women sexually harassed or worse made me think more about my own actions in my life.

I harassed, said somethings inappropriate, but never touched without making my intentions known... I always thought consent was important for touch, but never made that connection to the rest of my actions: degrading, objectifying, things said...

When I think about where I could have acted better and I did not, ... to be honest I wept. I wept harder than I've wept in a long time. I hadn't shed a single tear in eight years, truth be told.

I won't provide you a sob story, no justification. Just an apology. I remember all of them by name. I still can see their faces. I managed to contact one and apologize. She accepted. Which was - amazingly freeing.

I wish I could apologize to them all. I'd spend the rest of my life doing just that if I had to.

I have no idea how this internet works or if anyone will actually read this. But I wanted to say from the bottom of my heart how utterly contemptuous - even if ""minor"" or just ""locker-room chat"" how I acted... was. Is.

Somehow, I want to spend the rest of my life fighting this fight. I have no idea where to start. But I figured an apology was a good place.

My head is in a fog. Is there... I don't know, a way I can... volunteer time or find a career in... something that educates, or advocates, or... helps fight this... harassment culture?

Sorry. I had a beautiful post with correct grammar and all in my head and instead all you got was this... I'M SO SORRY, #MeToo.

&#x200B;

When I was entering kindergarten, I met my neighbors for the first time. There was this one teen they had, let's call him T in this story. When I first met T he was pretty cool. He swore a lot but at his age (12), it wasn't anything unusual. Me and him would hang out in our yards, dig holes, do stupid things like throw rocks onto the road, stuff like that.

After a while he invited me over to his house. When I went in there I was dumbfounded. It was dirty. Extremely dirty. There was a huge pile of boxes where the stairs bent, there was M&Ms, Soda/Beer cans (I don't know if it was one or the other, or both), and there where stains all over the carpet. His mother who watched TV on the sofa was a bit loud, and didn't seem to do much around the house. When I went into his basement it was even worse. They had a cat and obviously it's favorite place to go to the bathroom was the basement. There was piss stains all over the place and clutter. Oh god was there clutter. You literally had to raise your feet about 3 feet and then roll yourself to get to where they had a TV, couch, and a PS2. I was only seven at the time, and I watched T played some GTA 3. I had fun watching him, and he knew I shouldn't have been seeing some of the stuff in the game so he only drove like a maniac on the roads, not doing any missions. I left his house later that day.

One day he invited me again, (by now I had been there three or four times), and so I came. When I got inside I noticed his mother wasn't there. I already knew that she worked in the afternoons but usually she didn't allow T to invite people when she wasn't home. This time T told me to go upstairs, and that he would be up in a little bit. I figured he got something to eat. When he came upstairs we talked for a while about stuff I don't remember. Then he asked me if I wanted to create a ""secret handshake"" with him. Being a kid who liked stupid secret things that where hidden from others I agreed. He then told me to take off my clothes. I was weirded out by this, but being innocent and never receiving the talk from parents/teachers about protecting yourself, I did what he asked. He then took his clothes off as well. He asked me to lie in his bed and I obliged. He came in with me.

I will not discuss what happened in that bed but just so you can understand, I was told to both receive and give in a variety of sexual means. I knew something was wrong but of course after what took place I didn't tell anyone as he asked me, but also because I felt embarrassed to talk about it to my parents/peers. He would invite me to his house once every week, and since my parents always wanted me to get out of the house and play with others, I didn't have an excuse to avoid him. One out of two times he would make me partake in this ""secret handshake"".

This continued until I was in grade 4 or 5, before I had done sexual education. Around this time, their family was evicted from their home. I remember that once I actually started getting into sex ed and realizing just what had happened and what he truly had done to me, I excused myself 15 minutes into the class to go to the bathroom, where I uncontrollably sobbed for about ten minutes straight.

In grade 5, when I actually had figured out what really happened, I felt even more guilty and embarrassed to talk about it. I started having this vivid and repetitive nightmare, where I would be trapped in the closet they had at T's house, and would either be silent and doing nothing at all or yelling and screaming, while I would hear T climbing up the stairs with T  saying cryptic things like ""Wanna do the handshake?"" and ""We won't be too long"". I always wake up before he opens the closet, and I am gaining a lot of weight because I hard binge in the middle of the night every time I wake up.

Also, because of the huge amount of paranoia and insomnia I would and still do experience during the night, I often fall asleep in class, which would lead me to get picked on in early junior high and my grades dropping overall. I went from a 92% average in early junior high to a high 60% in high school. I get really nervous when sexual tensions arise between me and intimate partners, and I never admit why to them for fear of getting ridiculed.

I stayed quiet for a long time, and I would usually mask my inner feelings at that time by being loud and obnoxious to those who tried to interact with me, and because of this I had no friends until grade 8, when I met this amazing group of people who shared the same interests as me. We remain great friends to this day (grade 11).

I had three suicide attempts, one in grade 7, and two in grade 9. Luckily I was too scared to fully commit, but those points where probably the lowest in my life, and I would never want to repeat the mindset I was in back then.

The only two people I had only ever told this story to where two of my closest friends within that group, until recently since I had told my brother and my mom about a month ago. They have suggested counselling, which I am booked for in the near future. Though I am less shy and willing to talk to people, I can't stop remembering those awful moments and images stuck in my head from that time back when I was younger, and I wish it had never happened.

I‚Äôm sorry that I have trouble opening up because of the rough callous layer that developed from years of pain and self recovery. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt communicate these issues with you because even thinking about these facts sends me down a spiral of anxiety where I lose myself in sadness.

I‚Äôm sorry that I don‚Äôt want to share my past with those around me because I fear how they will change the way they look at me and redefine me as a victim. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt publicly share my experiences with #metoo to empower others because I am still looking for the power within that was stolen. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I struggled to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù as a statistic that would otherwise help those around me see how prevalent sexual assault and abuse are. 

We‚Äôve heard the numbers and facts about sexual assault and abuse on women and children. Remember that those numbers are just estimates of the ones brave enough to come out and share. Remember this when you start a relationship with someone, and respect their need for space and pace. 

Respect should be unconditional, and not acquired after hearing about someone‚Äôs past. Respect for space and consent should be a given, and not just given to those who choose to share their story. ",7,0,meToo,silentlyempowering,1,2019-01-21 16:15:40

In fact I‚Äôm not sure I even wanna share it but I have been feeling down lately. I need to express it to those not close to me. I fear burdening them with my experience may hurt them. It may twist their image of me.
I joined the military about a year ago to take me away from a life I thought I could never escape. It has been my safe haven. The friends I‚Äôve made here have given me a bond I never believed capable. Memories from my past have haunted me each day though. The faces of those that stole my innocence still walk around in my dreams, the Walmart in my hometown, and my mother‚Äôs house. 
I grew up with two parents that eventually fell out of love and my brother. My very first memories were of physical abuse. 
My brother would torture me. I‚Äôd be punished for things as small as making his sandwich wrong. As I got older around 8 it became sexual as well. 
I lived everyday in fear and when my parents divorced it left me alone with my abuser for more prolonged periods of time. His friends would touch me and rape me. By age 10 I barely spoke outside of my home. I lost interest in kids my age and became overcome with constant thoughts of my own abuse.I would replay the memories in my head of my constant abuse.
One night his friend snuck in the room I shared with my mom. She took heavy sleeping pills to get to sleep at night. He pulled the curtain that separated me from my moms side and stroked my hair. I immediately froze. I pushed but I was so small. Oh I remembered this feeling. My body went numb as he choked me and kissed my face. I could feel myself bleeding as he penetrated me. I tried to speak but my mouth didn‚Äôt move. He thanked me as if I had welcomed his touch.
The next morning I laid there in my tub before school washing over the bruises and putting on my favorite sweater. That‚Äôs what you do. You put on the long sleeve shirt and don‚Äôt speak. Everything‚Äôs hurts and you‚Äôll sit out during PE. You don‚Äôt talk like you used to if at all. The teachers try to get the other kids to play with you but you show no interest and they leave.
It‚Äôs so confusing as a kid to recognize trauma in others when you haven‚Äôt experienced it for yourself. Years passed and the abuse continued. I can‚Äôt write them out right now I‚Äôm already crying too much and my friends are coming over soon. I‚Äôm sorry for sharing this but I had to write some of it out right now.

Was this assault?,7,a9sgc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a9sgc7/was_this_assault/,3,1545858856.0,"To give a little background on my story: I've recently been going to therapy with my husband of 1 year and in the sessions we have covered some things concerned with my relationship with my mother. She began physically abusing me when I was about 15 until I was about 19 ( I am 26 now). One of the topics we covered was about trust and I think it has caused some suppressed memories to surface. 

I had dated the same boy from 15-19. On a night when I was 15 and he was 16, my mom let him stay over with 2 of my friends and myself. We were all going to sleep in my room. My bf and I went to sleep pretty early and way before the other 2 came into my room. I remember waking up to find my bf with his fingers inside of me. I was really confused at the time and uncomfortable because it hurt. I asked what he was doing and he said nothing and removed his hand pretty quickly and rolled over to sleep. I didn't sleep that night but didnt tell anyone what had happened until the next morning. 

I remember going to my mom to say that the bf had done something that I wasn't comfortable with and I am pretty sure she had asked if he had raped me but I said no he had just used his hand. I cant remember exactly how the rest played out  but I remember sitting in a garage with both of them and asking him to leave. He did but my mom never mentioned anything after that even though I was crying and upset and never brought it up ever. I continued to date this person until I was 19.

But I also let them pick me up from my own house and gave out my address because at that point I just didn't care about my well-being. 

One night this woman posted about looking for another girl to come over and hang out with her and her roommates. Have a party so to speak. I hit her up, or maybe she hit me up, i can't exactly remember.

She drove the hour and thirty minutes to my place and took us back to hers. We get there. I met her two roommates, one much older dude and another young female. Suddenly there's drinks but there's also drugs. I'm trying to look like a badass. So I snort a line of something that rhymes with nethamphetamine. Smoke some too. 

There's talk of sex. I sloppily sign a handwritten ""form of consent"" because I was high on NEMTH for the first time and obviously very tipsy too. I was a child surrounded by adults. 

I don't remember much after that. I remeber going for a swim with the guy and initiating something. But the rest of the night is a blur. 

I wake up and it takes an hour for me to notice my face is all beat up. Black eyes, cuts and bruises. Puffy. They say I ""insulted"" the woman who had picked me up. So she punched me. Did she do it more than once? She must have. Guy says he didn't hit me. I don't belive him. 

Everyone in the house is rude to me. I can't go home, i don't have a ride. No money. I'm hours away. 

I call my parents eventually. They've been trying like mad to call me all day. Worried as hell even though I lied and said I was going to be staying with a friend when I left. I lied. I said I was at a party with said friend and got stupid drunk. I started a fight because someone spilled their drink on me and I got my ass handed back to myself. 

They believed me. Why wouldn't they? They had no idea I was partying with drug dealers.

The guy drove me home (begrudgingly). I walked into the house all smiles. ""Yeah, I'm okay. It just hurts a bit. Great party though.""

I found out I had contracted chlymidia a few days later.

Only later would I begin thinking about how I was too drunk/high to consent. How hurt I actually was by it. And how hurt it still has me to this day.

I know, i made bad decisions. I know i basically asked for it. But that doesn't make it any easier to live with. 

I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest. ",8,0,meToo,missnothiing,1,2018-11-25 20:10:00
I need help knowing if I was assaulted or not,7,9v1agw,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9v1agw/i_need_help_knowing_if_i_was_assaulted_or_not/,14,1541610903.0,"My boyfriend has always been a bit pushy about sex. We have been together for two years now. He's pressed to do it in public before, and I've even gotten suspended once because of him.

Last night we decided to be intimate, but we didn't have a condom. I said it was fine and decided to just help finish him off. He asked if he could touch me, but I said no. A little later his hands had found their way into my pants, but I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. 

I forced him to stop and made him take me home. I was really upset and cried in the shower because I felt disgusting and unclean. I still do. I feel like my trust was violated. He's done this before, but for some reason I'm very shaken up about it this time. It made me remember some things that happened when I was a kid. He's also told me that he's touched me in my sleep before.

I don't know how to feel or what to do. I can't talk to my parents because I just got them to accept our relationship. I don't want to talk about this to any adults because I'm embarrassed to. I still love him a lot. I am so confused and upset. It almost feels like his actions are a different person. I don't know if it's assault, I don't want to claim a fake rape story or something. I didn't know where to post, so I thought here would be fine. 

Update: I appreciate every single one of your comments. The advice given to me has helped me decide what to do, and make the right decision. Thank you so much. I feel a lot better now.

He‚Äôll enter your life when you least expect it; people like him always do. It‚Äôll be at a time in your life when you finally feel like you‚Äôre doing the right thing. Life is going well for you, and you feel like you‚Äôve actually met a good guy. Then, with a swift, vague comment under an Instagram post, everything will crumble.

The comment will glare at you. He was a classmate of yours, and you‚Äôd noticed him. Thought he was admirably intelligent, even. You felt honored that he even took the time to comment. You will continue the banter, happy that someone else is initiating a conversation for once. Things are friendly, until he moves the conversation to your DMs. You‚Äôre uncomfortable, but you warily continue. You joke about his bad grammar, and things feel okay. You remind yourself how much you love the person you‚Äôre with now, and you tell yourself that you don't have feelings for this new guy.

Things will go on that way for a week or so. Just a couple comments under your photos, a couple DMs, until he gives you his number because his ‚ÄúInstagram DMs aren‚Äôt working.‚Äù You don‚Äôt like it, but you take it anyway. It‚Äôs nice to talk to him. You don‚Äôt have to talk about yourself as much.

It‚Äôs not until almost a month later that you meet up for a ‚Äúfriend date‚Äù to Chipotle. He‚Äôs begun sitting with you at lunch to ‚Äúcopy notes,‚Äù and your almost-boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like it. You brush it off; things are purely platonic. You don‚Äôt tell your significant other about the friend date. You tell your best friend that you‚Äôre freaking out. He loves *Star Wars*, and you‚Äôve never seen it, so you watch it together at your house. You sit on separate ends of the sofa. You realize that night that you really like him. You ‚Äúbreak off‚Äù things with your significant other (AKA ghost him because you don‚Äôt know how to tell him that you‚Äôve found someone else).

The flirting starts up after that. You hang out every weekend, invite each other to social gatherings, and eventually, you start dating. It feels good. You like him. He seems kind enough, and it feels like he really cares about you. People keep telling you that you're way out of his league, but you laugh it off and tell them that it's not about what he looks like, because he seems like a genuinely good person. You were wrong.

Less than a month into the relationship, he‚Äôs finished his junior year of high school. He almost doesn‚Äôt pass chemistry, and he gets angry over a lower grade than he thought he deserved. He starts to get violent. His parents are home, but they don‚Äôt stop him. He‚Äôs screaming‚Äîbut you wouldn‚Äôt call it screaming because it‚Äôs more like a growling that pierces your ears and you can't escape‚Äîand his mom tries to calm him down before he hurts someone. You cover your ears so you don't hear it. His parents don't notice that you're doing this. You‚Äôre terrified, but you don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs a red flag. The relationship continues, and he apologizes for scaring you.

When you tell him about your self-harm and depression during a phone call, he cries. He tells you that he loves you. You don‚Äôt know what else to say, so you repeat it to him even though you don‚Äôt know if you mean it. You‚Äôre scared of what he‚Äôll do if you don‚Äôt, but you won‚Äôt admit it to yourself. After all, he was only violent once, and it wasn't directed at you, so why should you be worried? You say to yourself that you love him until you actually do. It feels good to love someone. You start to think that maybe he‚Äôs the love of your life.

Around month two things start to become less platonic. You‚Äôre afraid to do anything with him, because you‚Äôve been taken advantage of before. Never raped or molested, but forced into doing something that you weren‚Äôt ready to do. You told yourself that he was different, and he would never do something like that to you. In the dim light of the first *Harry Potter* movie playing on his TV, you can see his face when he begs you to make out him. You tell him that you want to but you don't think you‚Äôre ready. It‚Äôs 10:15 and you have to be home for 10:30. You beg him to take you home because your mom will be angry if you‚Äôre late. He tells you he won‚Äôt until you make out with him. You say no. Eventually, he grabs your face and starts making out with your unmoving lips. You open your mouth to gasp in shock, and he takes it as an invitation to shove his tongue down your throat. He doesn‚Äôt stop until he realizes you‚Äôre not kissing him back, and there are tears in your eyes. You don‚Äôt think that he did anything wrong. You think that you were just too much of a prude to consent to it, and he needed to force you to, because if he didn't, you would never feel like you were ready to.

You think that he‚Äôs learned his lesson, and he won‚Äôt do anything like that again after he sees you crying. But, after the relationship starts to take on a sexual nature, he starts begging for ""real"" sex. You tell him you‚Äôre not ready yet, and you need to do it on your own terms. He agrees to it. One night, you decide that you think you‚Äôre ready. But, when he parks the car and tells you to hop in the backseat, you‚Äôre terrified. *What if it hurts? What if it‚Äôs not good? What if he won‚Äôt stop when you ask him to?* You're afraid that if your first time is with him, then one day you'll regret it. You curl into a ball in his backseat and listen to him beg you. *If we just start, you‚Äôll get into it. It‚Äôll start to feel good after awhile. You‚Äôre just overthinking it, and you‚Äôre nervous.* You try to repeat what he's saying and rationalize with yourself, even though you don't think that it's true. You know it's too early for sex, and you think that you're not ready, but you won't tell him. You pretend like you still want to do this, because you're afraid to disappoint him. You stay that way - curled up in the back seat, as far away from him as possible - for about 30 minutes. He starts to get annoyed. *Did I drive all the way here just for you to do this? What are you so scared of? I won't hurt you.*

Finally, you give in. You climb on top of him. He puts the condom on after a long struggle. You‚Äôre terrified. He puts it in. It's the worst sensation you've ever felt. You yelp in pain and tell him you need to stop. He says that it might stop hurting if you just keep going. You tell him no and that you just need a second to adjust. You get off of him, and you curl into your ball again. He tries to convince you to retry. He starts kissing you. You decide that maybe he‚Äôs right. Eventually, you get back on top of him. He puts it in. You‚Äôre overwhelmed with the pain. You try to tell him to stop, but you‚Äôre afraid that he'll get angry. You think about the time when he was screaming about his grades. You feel sick.

After he doesn‚Äôt submit the first time you suggest that maybe you should stop (*It feels too good, maybe it'll start to feel that way for you soon too*), you give in and let it happen. You leave your mind and think about anything else but what's happening to you right now. Silent tears run down your face the entire time, and you think that he doesn't notice, because he doesn't stop. You pretend that it feels good. You try to convince yourself that it did.

When he finally takes you home, you run to the bathroom, sit on the toilet, curl into your ball and cry. You start gagging, thinking that you might throw up. You cry until it feels like you can‚Äôt breathe anymore. You cry until there are no more tears and you‚Äôre just whimpering like an injured dog. You don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs his fault. You don't tell anyone, especially not him, about what you felt that night. You pretend that it was the best experience of your life. You don't want to admit that your first time was not consensual.

You‚Äôre terrified to try again for two or three times after that. But, your brain eventually blocks out the first time, and you fall wholeheartedly in love with him. He‚Äôll look at your scars and kiss the places that you cut yourself. His lips feel like sandpaper. Those are his good days. On his bad days, he screams at his parents, and, when you try to comfort him, he turns on you too. You think that this is what a healthy relationship looks like.

Things are okay until the fifth month. One morning you‚Äôre riding to school together and you‚Äôre telling him about how you want to make things right with your ex-but-not-ex that you left for your now-boyfriend, but your ex-but-not-ex is being really hostile. He gets angry and screams at you. He tells you that you would be pissed if he talked about his ex this much. You would be pissed if he still wanted to talk to his ex after she treated him the way she did. You think he‚Äôs right.

You think that the fight is over, but when you‚Äôre sitting on the benches at school, he screams at you again. You cry and ask your mom to pick you up from school. He apologizes over and over. He begs you not to leave him. He shows up at your house with flowers and your favorite candy after school. You forgive him. He doesn‚Äôt do it again for awhile. From then on, you‚Äôre afraid to talk to him about how you feel because you don‚Äôt want him to scream at you again. You don't tell him that you've started wondering if his ex left him because he treated her like this too. Maybe she was smart to leave him early on, because she could start to really love him. You swallow those thoughts and don't allow them to resurface.

A year into the relationship, he starts to forget about how much you mean to him. It feels like your first anniversary marks the death of the guy you fell in love with. He stops writing letters to you. He stops apologizing after he screams at you. He stops trying to help you when you‚Äôre upset and just says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù He tells you that it's because you're upset so often and you don't want to listen to anything he has to say. He tells you that it's because he's tired of watching you put yourself into this position and make people feel bad for something you did to yourself. He stops bringing you flowers after a fight, or just on random occasions because ""he loves you."" He starts to think that he‚Äôs superior. Anytime you have differing opinions, he is never wrong. This is the stage when he first tells you that you're ""acting crazy."" He decides that video games are more important than you and stops spending as much time with you. When you ask him why, he says that it's because you expect too much of him, and you always do the same things when you're together and he gets bored.

For college, you want to leave the state. So does he. The difference is that you‚Äôve worked your ass off to do so all your life, while he‚Äôs only started his junior year. He doesn‚Äôt even apply to the college he wants because he knows he won‚Äôt get in. He doesn‚Äôt get into any other out-of-state colleges that he's applied to, and he settles for one an hour away from you. That hour-distance feels like a planet away. He promises you he won‚Äôt change when he leaves for college. You promise him you will love him no matter what. And you hold your end of the bargain. He doesn't, and you don't really blame him.

Your fights become an almost everyday occurrence. You provoke them, because it‚Äôs the only time he gives you his undivided attention. He has a different life now, one where he‚Äôs never with you. When you see him on weekends, he‚Äôs counting down the seconds till he goes back to school. He spends all his time on his phone or laptop, ""conducting meetings"" for his esports club or talking to his British friend. He‚Äôs worshipped like a god at school because he‚Äôs honed his video game skills when he‚Äôs not talking to you and he‚Äôs become really good. He tells you that he‚Äôs finally found a place where he feels like he belongs. You‚Äôre terrified because that place doesn‚Äôt include you.

In the middle of your senior year, you start applying for colleges. You apply to the college that he‚Äôs at, mostly because he wants you to (and because you‚Äôre terrified that he‚Äôll forget you altogether if you don‚Äôt go to school with him). You also apply to an out-of-state college, a school that you've dreamed of going to for years. It‚Äôs in New York, 1500 miles away from him. He tells you that he refuses to move with you this year or any other year, and even though you‚Äôre upset, a part of you understands. You wouldn‚Äôt do it for him either. But, it‚Äôs easier to stay in-state for the person you love than to move across the country with them, and you were at an unfair advantage and expecting too much of him.

When you get your acceptance letter from you dream college, he‚Äôs the first person you tell. His response is, ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM SO PROUD OF YOU but please don‚Äôt leave me.‚Äù You tell you ex-but-not-ex, and he is ecstatic. He supports you 100%, and so does your mom. You tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre not even sure you want to go because the school doesn‚Äôt have stellar ratings, even though it‚Äôs a lie and you‚Äôve already made up your mind that you're going. You start to suggest that maybe things in the relationship will go sour if you move away (as if they hadn't already). He tells you that if you move away, he doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôll last together, and you tell him the same thing. You‚Äôre angry at that, and you start to provoke more fights. You spend time with your ex/not-ex on days that you could be spending with him. Your boyfriend starts a fight with you because he thinks you‚Äôre into this other guy. You don‚Äôt know how to tell him that, yes, you do have feelings for him because he treats you better than your boyfriend ever has.

Now, his favorite phrases when you fight are, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ridiculous, you‚Äôre crazy, you‚Äôre totally in-fucking-sane.‚Äù He tells you that this is why a college student shouldn't date a high schooler, because you're too immature and expect too much out of life. You‚Äôre holding onto the relationship for dear life. You ask him to put more effort into the relationship. He tells you that you need to stop imagining life as a fairytale because it‚Äôs not. You don‚Äôt want a fairytale, you just want him back. He says that maybe you weren't meant to be, that that was just a high school delusion. You're angry because he's the one that put that idea in your head in the first place, and now he's ripping it away from you.

The first time you threaten to break up with him, he says that you‚Äôll never find anyone that will ""put up with your shit"" like he has. That pisses you off. You tell him that you can‚Äôt believe he said that to you, but you don't retaliate by saying anything worse than he has. He always seems to insult you, and you're always too afraid and too in love with him to insult back. You cry all night and ask yourself why you‚Äôre so problematic. You realize that you've become codependent on him, and that you truly don't believe that anyone will put up with your shit, and that you're lucky to even have him.That's when the voice that speaks all the negative thoughts in your head becomes his. That's when you start imagining him ridiculing you for thinking the things you do.

He starts to tell you every fight after that that no one will put up with you the way that he does, and every time, it hurts more. There's no doubt in your mind that he's right. After an incident (when a girl that you thought outwardly liked him and was making passes at him showed up to a ""party"" that he was at and neglected to tell you), you are outraged. You're trying to find any reason to start a fight with him so that he'll pay attention to you.

You talk to your friends in a desperate attempt to salvage this broken relationship. They‚Äôre pissed at his audacity, and they tell you that there‚Äôs no fixing it. He‚Äôs a piece of shit that doesn‚Äôt deserve you. When he finds out that your friends know, he is furious. He says that now he‚Äôs being painted as the bad guy, when all of this is actually your fault. You tell him that you didn‚Äôt do anything but show them texts, and you know you shouldn‚Äôt have because they‚Äôre private, but you were desperate. He tells you to never involve them in your issues again or he‚Äôs leaving you. Threatening to break up has been a commonality between both of you during fights. It's the one thing you're both most terrified of.

You try everything. You ask him to make a list of everything he thinks you should fix about yourself, and you‚Äôll look at it. You try to do the same for him. He writes yours after a terrible fight, and you write yours when you‚Äôre thinking about how afraid you are of losing him. The title of his list to you is ""Things Gabby needs to change in order for this relationship to not be shit.""Yours is just ""Things that I think could change."" It was probably a bad idea in the first place.

He tells you that your problems are always the only ones that seem to matter during important times, and that you're unappreciative of him. He says that you need to let it go when he sleeps all day when you've made plans to hang out, even though those days are the only times you're ever able to see him. He tells you that most of the problems in your relationship have stemmed from you. He suggests that you're only with him because he has money. (You don't mention that you're the only one in the relationship that has a job and coughs up money for him nearly every time you eat together. You don't tell him that you've spent over $100 on a gift for him, despite the fact that he neglected doing anything except show up for free food on your birthday.) He tells you that you have complained about the relationship for months but have never tried to fix anything. He tells you that he will read over your list and ""respond where he sees fit.""

You ask him to be less angry. You ask him to stop calling you names. You ask him to stop making you feel like your feelings are invalid. You ask him to not make you so afraid of ever approaching him about issues because he gets so angry. You ask him to be more honest with you. You ask him to TRY to fix this as much as you are.

You start taking your antidepressants again, because he‚Äôs convinced you that you have to be crazy to do things like this to him. You do it as a last-ditch effort. You tell him, ‚ÄúI started taking my meds again.‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúGood. You need to.‚Äù

You stop seeing each other in the last month of your relationship. You text your ex/not-ex (who is finally your best friend again) every time you fight, and he tries to help you, but he hates him so he can‚Äôt say much. Every day is spent fighting. You tell him you want to just take a week to not talk to him. He tells you that you‚Äôre basically breaking up with him for a week and that‚Äôs fucked up. You tell him that you‚Äôre not; you love him too much to do that. You just need time to think about how to fix this. You don‚Äôt realize that you‚Äôre the only one trying anymore.

The weekend before you break up, he comes to your house to try to talk things over. He keeps his arms crossed the whole time. He throws the list you made for him back at you and says that it‚Äôs unrealistic and he can‚Äôt do anything with it. He spends the whole time telling you why you‚Äôre acting like a child. You finally tell him that maybe he should go home before you do something you don‚Äôt want to. He says nothing and walks out of the room, leaving you crying.

A couple days before you break up, you call him. Two minutes into the conversation, you‚Äôre screaming. Just you. You spend twenty minutes telling him everything he‚Äôs done to you. You‚Äôre seething. You don‚Äôt know what to do with yourself. You tell him that maybe you should break up. He starts screaming too. He says that maybe you should. You ask him to give you more time. He relents. Hours later, you call him crying and begging him to at least try to fix things. He finally realizes how much this relationship means to you, and how lucky he is to have you. He sends you a text later that night saying that he loves you and feels like a piece of shit for the way he treated you. You respond saying that you‚Äôre glad he‚Äôll try to put more effort into the relationship. He says that he never said he would do that, and that he doesn‚Äôt see how he‚Äôs not already putting all of himself into the relationship. You tell him that you think that this is the end of the road. He says that if you don't fix yourself, there's no way that the relationship will last much longer. You ask yourself why you're so crazy. You start to think about committing suicide again.

The day of your breakup is gloomy and overcast. You can‚Äôt remember what the fight was even about. Midway through a text conversation, you say that you think things are over. You‚Äôre trying to gather the courage to stand up for yourself and tell him to come over so you can break up with him. Before you can, he says that he can‚Äôt do this anymore. He says that he‚Äôs breaking up with you. You tell him that you deserve more than to be broken up over text so disrespectfully. He says he‚Äôs on his way to your house to do it in person. You think that he wants to talk things over. You still think that he‚Äôs salvageable.

When he gets to your house, his arms are crossed again. Your mom is sitting between you as a mediator, mostly because she‚Äôs afraid that he‚Äôll hit you. You try to start a conversation but he interrupts you and says that there‚Äôs nothing for you to talk about. That he‚Äôs made up his mind and he‚Äôs just here to break up in person, like you asked. He doesn‚Äôt say much else after that. His foot is tapping incessantly. His face is beet red. You start crying and asking him why he won‚Äôt even try. You tell him that he stopped trying a long time ago, and he doesn‚Äôt deserve all the effort you‚Äôve put into the relationship. You‚Äôre so pissed that you say, ‚ÄúOkay, goodbye then. Leave.‚Äù Your mom asks why you can‚Äôt just sit down and talk. He says that he‚Äôs talked for way too long, and that you've ruined this relationship.

You‚Äôre halfway up the stairs when you ask, ‚ÄúWhat am I doing? Am I really allowing this to end over a stupid fight?‚Äù You run as fast as you can downstairs, ask your mom if he‚Äôs left yet. She says no. You run outside barefoot with no bra on. You say, ‚ÄúWhat are we doing? Are we really throwing everything away for this?‚Äù He says not to make this harder than it has to be. You say that you still love him. He says that he can‚Äôt do this anymore. You get angry and let him drive away. You cry into your mom‚Äôs arms for hours. Your now-best-friend comforts you that night. You lay with him and tell him about the break up. You put your head on his chest and cry. He comforts you and tells you that he doesn‚Äôt know how you put up with that for so long.

For months, you drive to his house on nights that you‚Äôre missing him or nights that you‚Äôre just sad. You listen to the playlist you made for but never showed to him, of all the songs that you both loved. You cry and sing the songs and imagine that he‚Äôs there holding your hand and singing too. You cry so hard that what's coming out of your mouth sound like a terrified animal taken to slaughter. You‚Äôre terrified of living a life without him. You cry to your best friend and say that he's ruined your psyche. You tell him that you hear his voice in your head every time you do something he wouldn't like. You hear him telling you that you‚Äôre crazy, that you‚Äôre wrong, that you‚Äôll never find anyone to put up with your shit.

Even writing this now, you can hear his voice in your head telling you that you're crazy, that he‚Äôs never abused you in any way, and that you were just as terrible as he was. Sometimes, you believe that that‚Äôs true. If he thinks that it is, you hope that he can forgive you, because no one should ever feel the way that you have. But, when you think that, you remember telling him that he calls you terrible names, and you never insult him back. He even agreed with you. You wonder now how someone can acknowledge that they‚Äôre so terrible to another person, but still be seemingly blind to the harm they‚Äôre causing you. You wonder if you'll ever be able to heal and forgive him. You wonder if you‚Äôll ever stop hearing his insults in your head.",6,0,meToo,gabbyfaithh,1,2018-10-18 04:34:15

About 6 months after we broke up, whilst at the beginnings of a fantastic relationship, I realised that my boyfriend used to assault me. I feel like it sounds strange to say that ""I realised"" it, but at the time I didn't notice all the little things that were wrong until I had a partner who truly respected me. I know he raped me on one occasion and I knew he did it at the time. I cried afterwards and asked why he did it when I said not to and he mumbled an apology and went to sleep. All the little things were almost worse though. He would constantly touch me when i didn't want him too, touch my breast or arse. He would try to ""seduce"" me as he put it when I wasn't in the mood for sex and he was. I often gave in because it was easier. When I wanted to stop, he still wanted to finish so he d touch himself beside me. He was never happy doing it alone so he would insist on touching me too. I'd get him to touch a part of myself with no stimulation. I don't even know why I'm typing this but I just need it down and out there. 

We have mutual friends still. He's in a band with one of my boyfriend's best friends and we'll never be able to support him at a gig because I can't see him again.

Today I spoke to someone who recognised me as his ex and said how he is one of her really good friends. I just needed to type this today.",5,0,meToo,isdabe95,1,2018-10-09 22:59:32

I told him no and he kept pressing. ""Just try it and if you don't like it I will stop"" he said. I didn't want to but I very reluctantly agreed on those terms. I didn't know it would hurt. I didn't like it and I told him to stop several times but he didn't. He didn't seem to care that it really hurt me. 
I was young and stupid back then and it was my first boyfriend. I don't know why I stayed with him. Especially after that. He ended up being mentally and emotionally abusive later, too. After we broke up I was scared of men for a while, and definitely scared of sex.

It‚Äôs also a bit long so sorry

Bit of a backstory, I‚Äôm a 16 year old male going through high school. In the 8th grade I had to leave my school because I was being socially ostracized and bullied. Just some typical teen shit that got amped up to the next level. For some reason, that whole experience has fucked me up probably more then it should have. It utterly changed my personality. Now I‚Äôm  basically useless in social situations and revert back to coping mechanisms like being an asshole and trying to be funny. Obviously this has left me with no friends, because no one likes that guy. I latch onto anyone who shows me any decency. That‚Äôs how I met the asshole who‚Äôs putting me through hell. He‚Äôs a friend of an ‚Äúacquaintance ‚Äù. He really really hates me and that‚Äôs where my whole metoo thing comes in. Sorry for the stupidly long back story.

He has an interesting way of showing his hate. Daily, he says he is going to rape me, murder me ‚Äúbite my nipples off‚Äù etc, all the whole spitting in my face, grabbing my ass, and even occasionally grabbing my dick. I feel powerless in the situation. For some reason unbeknownst to me, he calls me a pig and oinks at me and calls me a shitty little piggy and stuff. He‚Äôs trapped me in a booth and wouldn‚Äôt let me out till I oinked loudly in public. I‚Äôve repeatedly asked him to stop and he will say sure then lay off for a few weeks but then it just starts back up again. It‚Äôs fucking hell, and it‚Äôs seriously making me question life at this point. There‚Äôs only so much ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hang you by your intestines and fuck your slowly dying corpse‚Äù a dude can take. I can‚Äôt beat the shit out of him because he‚Äôs obese, and I‚Äôm weak, or else I would have by now. I‚Äôm currently seeing a therapist but I don‚Äôt feel like I can ever talk to him, or anyone about anything. All we talk about is stupid shit like ‚Äúcollege anxiety‚Äù and stuff like that. It sucks, because it‚Äôs eating me away inside and I feel trapped. It‚Äôs like a fucking prison.

I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting this, and I know I‚Äôm definitely going to come across as an attention whore, but I feel like I need *someone* to know. I can‚Äôt go talk to my councilor, because the people that are the closest things to my friends are super tight with him. 

As for why I‚Äôm posting here, instead of anywhere else, it‚Äôs because  the sexual abuse part gets to me the most. Sure it pails in comparison to what some people go through but I feel like it‚Äôs the most haunting part of all this. It really makes me feel worthless inside.

I‚Äôve also recently had a lot emotional and mental stress following leaving an abusive relationship. Most of all I‚Äôve been trying to work through the abuse my stepsister put me through.

Last night I was questioning what had happened to me as a child and my younger sister was with me so I decided to ask her about if she remembered anything strange. I asked if she remembered all of us sisters showering together when we were younger. She responded nonchalantly with ‚Äúhaha yeah and *older sister* would make me go first so I wouldn‚Äôt see anything. She‚Äôd always grab you and wash your back, you were so gullible‚Äù she didn‚Äôt mean it in an insulting way but right when she said that it was like a kick to the chest. I started to cry and when she realized I actually didn‚Äôt like what our sister had done she held me as I cried. She asked if I had told our mother and I explained that I was afraid that our parents would think I was just lying for a pity party. My sister encouraged me to tell her and at first I avoided it and refused. But I could literally already hear my sister ‚Äúprepping‚Äù my mom for the conversation. She didn‚Äôt tell her everything just that what our sister did made me uncomfortable and that I would explain it when I‚Äôm ready. Yes I‚Äôm mad but she knows my mother is the type that needs a beforehand warning. I was scared but I sat down with my sister and our mom and told her what happened. She was upset but more sorry that I had to go through that. She told me I have the right to say no when anything made me feel uncomfortable and that she wishes I had told them back then so they could‚Äôve done something about it. All in all she held me and told me that none of it was my fault, that family is not always your friend. I also explained that the reason I avoided our grandfathers funeral was because I knew that our sister would be there. I‚Äôm scared about what is to come next and if our dad will find out but I feel like the weight on my chest is a little lighter.

So I've been sexually assualted 3 times, once in college waking up to find my boyfriend's roommate rubbing my hand on his genitiles. another when a not so known cosplayer asked to stay over and raped me in my sleep and the last time where my ex fingered me in my sleep in what I think was a power move since his ex who he cheated on me with had confronted him about it and..yeah. 
The 3rd time it was in a public place, and there was video. I debated on what to do for almost a year because I wanted to believe he was better than that and it was a misunderstanding...I have PTSD from the rape. I'm confusing the feelings. -- He took the copy of the tape I had and destroyed it, then started going around and bashing my name and tearing me down. I tried going to the police but without the tape, it's just an exes fighting. No one cares. Now if I say anything, or disagree with shit he says it's held over my head. It also came to a point that another girl spoke out about him sexually harassing her and no one believed her...and I feel guilty as fuck. I should have said something. I should have never trusted him with the tape. But I don't know what to do to make it better now. I go to counseling. I try to move on...but knowing my ex is abusing other girls because I fucked up greatly bothers me. ",6,0,meToo,KMcDaniel28,1,2018-06-08 08:26:41

Advice needed for Speaking Up,8,7szbw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7szbw5/advice_needed_for_speaking_up/,0,1516914196.0,"So over six years ago I was invited to a party, drugged with a mixture of drugs including a large dose of LSD, and raped. The entire experience was disorienting and severely damaging to my mental and physical health. The rape itself is a blank spot.

I wrote down my memories of the entire night down the next day.

I went to a second party with the same people, managed to avoid being drugged. I saw one of the guys put something in a beer then send a different girl over to give it to me. I refused, she drank it, then she ended up passed out on the couch about a half hour later.

When I first spoke up about the rape the backlash was pretty severe from my family and my friend group and I folded. I said, ""Yes, I lied, you're right, I'm sorry."" then I went and hid for a while. 

Now, years later, I'm in a different supportive community that is having lots of talks about #MeToo and consent culture. We have a huge burning man camp. Everyone who comes has to sign a document talking about consent. 

There is a guy in the camp who was present at my rape, as well as at the second party. He was present several times during the drug trip rape. There is a picture of him drinking a beer and laughing 
 with one of the guys I know raped me while I'm huddled on the ground crying next to them.

I spoke to our leader of the camp without giving him details of exactly what happened and he asked me what I wanted to do, and I didn't really respond with much. There is a part of me that is still afraid. There is also a part of me that wants resolution in terms of acknowledgement and an apology.

The guy in question is building a solid presence in my community, and on reddit. His name is Antranik.

Again, I don't know if he was raped me, but I know for certain that he was present when I was raped and at a party where they were drugging women. 

I'm considering asking the leadership of my community to hold an intervention for me and help me confront him. However, if he did join in on my rape and the rape of other women then I will be putting myself in danger doing that.

I think if I let this go too long as some point without speaking I'm going to explode very loudly.

I don't know what to do and I would really like advice.",8,0,meToo,throwaway4200024,1,2018-01-26 00:03:16

Tickling to Touch Me,6,b6o87f,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b6o87f/tickling_to_touch_me/,12,1553806681.0,"I'm really hesitant to share this, because I always worry that this experience doesn't qualify as sexual assault/abuse. However, after a year of therapy I know that this was AT LEAST wrong and manipulative. 

Alright let's get into it, I guess. If you finish this, you'll have been in this for the long haul.

After graduating college, I was celebrating by doing my best to have the most chill summer I've ever had. This went well for a while because I was seeing some friends from high school that I'd probably see for the last time in my life. A few people I only had a loose association in high school with would contact me here and there through social media, wishing me a great life. However, one of these people ended up having... A darker intention. 

A little background about how I knew the guy: I played in my school's marching band for two years. Here, I made quite a few friends (abnormal for the antisocial person that I am), but most of them did not stick after I quit. The guy that messaged me out of the blue one day over the summer was also in marching band with me during that time. The only thing is: I had only had a few conversations with him during my time in band.

Anyway, when he messaged me he said that he wanted to get to know me and that he always thought I was someone he could be friends with. Why he waited until after I graduated, I'll never know. I had a boyfriend most of the time throughout high school, but you'll see later that this isn't something that would stop this guy. 

We ended up being friendly to each other well into my first year at college. I had only met up with him a few times over the summer, as he usually would ask me to lunch. I had a VERY hard time eating in front of people, but that's pretty much the only thing you could do to hang out casually with someone in my small town. So, I would put meeting him off for a while and then finally give in. Then he would ask me out to lunch a few days later and then I'd make excuses for a few weeks until I gave in again. 

Once I started college though, I no longer could justify to myself that the reason I didn't want to see him in person was because of my eating anxiety. I agreed every now and then to have him over to my dorm. However, I gradually became more and more uncomfortable with this. At some point during the time at my dorm, he'd begin tickling my sides. First of all, I hate being tickled. Secondly, I don't like being touched by people I'm not close to. But, at this point in my life I had ZERO backbone (due to anxiety, depression, very low self esteem, and a deep desire to make people happy) and would only nervously laugh when he'd tickle me. Eventually he'd stop tickling me and would just keep his hands on my sides. After a while, I'd make an excuse to shimmy out of his grasp since it made me so uncomfortable. 

The meet-ups would become more infrequent because of this. He'd text me saying how much enjoyed spending time with me and saying we should hang out again. I would make excuses for a long time or cancel outright on agreed upon plans. Now, I understand that would upset a normal person after a while. But, I would never actually stop texting him because I enjoyed having someone to talk to. He actually was nice to talk to. However, when he'd get upset at me he would manipulate me into feeling extremely guilty and like a horrible friend. In retrospect, this guy had the hugest nice-guy complex I had ever personally encountered. 

One day, my roommate had friends over on a day I said I'd see this guy out of guilt. He ended up convincing me to come to his house at midnight. We drove the thirty minutes to spend time in his room watching a movie. The drive over was actually nice (probably because he couldn't touch me). So, I was slightly more relaxed than normal around him. When we got to his room and I settled on to his bed (the only place you can sit in his room to see the television), he said I should take my jacket off. I did, but as I was taking it off he started ""helping me"" take it off. He ran his hands down my arms and then threw my jacket across the room. He moved behind me on the bed and I just stayed sitting, because I did not want to lay down with him. I adjusted my shirt and asked what we were going to watch. Before I was even finished asking though, he said ""Oh, your shirt is a little crinkled"" and he slid his hands up and down my sides to ""smooth"" my shirt. I muttered an uneasy ""thanks"" before I asked my question again. He said we'd watch a horror movie because he knew they were my favorite. We watched Babadook. 

After maybe... Ten minutes into the movie he said I should lie down because he couldn't see well past me. So I foolishly laid down next to him. At this point we were about a foot away from each other. But every few minutes he would adjust and move a tiny bit closer to me. Eventually his body was pressed against my back. I stayed where I was because at least his pelvis wasn't pressed against my ass. (Like I said, I had no backbone.) 

I believe there was a jumpscare that caused me to well, jump. He put his hand on my hip and chuckled. He made fun of how jumpy I was and told me to ""settle back down"" and rubbed my hip, just barely grazing my ass. I moved a little away from him, but he placed his hand on my stomach and pulled me entirely to him. His pelvis was now on my ass and I could feel he was hard.

I hate what happened next and when I began feeling comfortable telling a few people about my experience, this became the hardest detail to say. 

He started tickling me again, making me squirm. This forced me to inadvertently grind into him. He stopped tickling and just grabbed my hip tightly to grind into me harder for a few seconds, I could not move. Then he shifted back to the other side of the bed. 

The movie eventually ended and we left. I never saw him again. And I told him I didn't want to see him again. This made him very angry and he started using intense manipulation tactics to try to get me to reconsider. One of the last things he said to me before I blocked him was ""I have my friends, family, and God to make me a better person. I pray that you'll become a nicer, stronger person."" 

Yes, he's a Christian. And he's one of the main reasons that means nothing to me anymore when it comes to deciding if someone is going to be worth trying to have in my life. 
I talked to some people from my high school about him (not telling them what he did) and apparently he has done stuff like this to several girls with boyfriends over the years.

He still messages me to this day (three years later) on different sites asking me to be his friend again. Also, last year I saw him leaving my dorm building with a girl and I had a full on panic attack on the street.",6,0,meToo,,1,2019-03-28 23:58:01

He apparently knew a lot about me except most of it was all lies. Jason knew me from my ex and I barely even knew Jason. According to Jason my ex told him I was a sexual panther and that I like pain etc.... and Jason asked me out I said no of course I came out as asexual in highschool and Jason kept saying ""No ones asexual if you felt this d*ck you'd change your mind"" one school day he caught me alone in the hallway on the way to art class I didn't see or hear him following me he grabbed me and started to sexually assault me saying  ""did you like that"" I was so angry and I shook him off and started crying I ran to talk to the school's councilor what's worse is that when I told her she told me ""oh don't worry he's just FLIRTING WITH YOU it's normal for boys that age to have a crush"" I told her he's been taking pictures of me without my knowledge and she's like ""alright I call his mom"" next day after that nothing happened to him he kept following me he didn't get in trouble he only got a warning. I felt so upset I didn't know who else to talk to for help I started to believe that no one would help me Jason continued sexually assaulting me for almost 2 years I been  sexually abused as a child and I've lost a lot of confidence in myself....my whole highschool years has all been different types of  sexual assaults by different people and non helpful teachers and staff  I told my mom but we weren't in a good relationship either so I ended up staying silent and giving up on relationships with  people I barely keep friends I have bad depression and PTSD I get super anxious being around anyone even my family I don't trust anymore it hurts I went to therapy to improve but I don't seem to be improving...

Keeping the crazy,6,awvd8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/awvd8o/keeping_the_crazy/,7,1551629406.0,"A few weeks ago some friends and I (bunch of gay guys) hit up a few bars for a night of drinks and music. We ended up at a regular hangout and the shots began to flow. Some rando attempted to make his move aggressively on me a couple of times but I really wasn‚Äôt all that into it. We were at the bar and I bought us a shot anyway. 

Now it‚Äôs closing time and my recollection gets super hazy going forward. But I do remember that somehow, friends disperse and I end up meeting the same rando on the sidewalk. We walked together and he begins to tell me how much he wants to fuck me. I tell him that isn‚Äôt happening and that I‚Äôm usually the one doing the topping. 

Next memory is stumbling into a hotel room with him. I take a piss in the bathroom and when I come out into the room, he‚Äôs naked and stroking with lotion. I‚Äôm trying to be casual about it and say that we‚Äôre twisted drunk and just need to sleep it off. Next memory is pain, feeling him inside me, telling him to stop, biting the pillow and not being able to move my arms.

I wake up a few hours later. He‚Äòs dressing, opening the curtains and looking out at the city. My head is pounding. I‚Äòm in bed with only a t-shirt on. He turns and makes his way toward me. My vision is blurry and I try blinking a bunch but my contacts are dry. 

As he stands next to the bed, fully clothed and bundled for the cold, he asks me about being ‚Äúclean‚Äù before leaving the room. I go to the bathroom, survey the damage, clean myself inside and out. Did that really just fucking happen?? I‚Äôm a built guy. Nobody fucks with me. 

Ha! How naive!

It‚Äôs been a few weeks. I‚Äôve had a few conversations with my nearest and dearest. Reactions have run the gamut and I‚Äôve allowed myself to feel like a victim at times and a deserving slut at other times. 

I know better. But the needle is still stuck in the groove. I‚Äôve kept the crazy of that night...at random times, I open the little bottle of hotel lotion and smell it or I pull out the bar receipt for the shots we took or I listen to tracks that were playing in the bar that night. Any of those things transport me back. Why can‚Äôt I remember? Do I want to remember? How naive.",6,0,meToo,dickotomous,1,2019-03-03 19:10:06
Hashtag for offenders?,7,asng9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/asng9e/hashtag_for_offenders/,3,1550663512.0,"Hello.  


I'm here to ask you something, that probably sounds rather weird but i'd be happy if you would hear me out and reply.

&#x200B;

The past 1,5 years i've been very vocal when it came to supporting #MeToo

&#x200B;

I'm a survivor myself and so are a lot of my friends (no matter if male/female/Nonbinary).

However. It partially feels insincere, because i also was an offender when i was a lot younger. I sexually harassed a woman. I emotionally manipulated two women into Sex. And all three times i didn't even realize that i was doing it. It took me years to evaluate my own behavior and realize ""Wow. You were such a piece of shit.""

I've been debating myself if i should make the bad things i did public. Basically add another perspective to the whole cause.  
For one, men who don't even realize when they do something bad and hurt someone.

And also, offenders acknowledging that what they did was wrong.

&#x200B;

Not just wait until they get accused and then apologizing along the lines of ""Sorry i got caught"" but proactive. Showing that it's important to reevaluate yourself and what you did. And acknowledging it.

I thought that maybe this would help that more men re-evaluate their behavior if more men speak up that they acknowledge their wrongdoings in the past.  


But before i do this, i would have liked your opinion about it and if i would do it, if it would make sense to use a specific hashtag for this. Maybe one already exists?

new rules in the workplace,7,akp3dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/akp3dk/new_rules_in_the_workplace/,2,1548693034.0,"repost from OfficePolitics subreddit....

&#x200B;

I  started a new job a few months ago. It was going great. Got along with  my boss swimmingly well! So lucky to have a boss like that. He believed  in me, and I believed in/liked/wanted to please him. It was great!

Then,  one fine day, I was interacting with the exec. assist to the CEO about  parking and other little stuff. I complimented her on her shirt, and the  use of color. Hard to remember now, but I know I mentioned the use of  red, white, and blue. So maybe that was more than just the shirt, but  whatever else she had on, like a scarf of accessories or something. In  other words, nothing below what is visible when someone is sitting down  at a desk.

Next  day, I saw another co-worker crossing the hall as I got in. He, I  suspect, is gay, but I am certainly not going to ask. I admired his red  shirt and how it was coordinated with his red shoes of the same shade of  red. Coordinated to say the least. There was little stopping me from  complimenting him on his ensemble, except he was on his way to another  room.

I  get to my desk, and am immediately called into HR. Turns out I am not a  good cultural fit, according to HR. Pack your bags, get your stuff, you  are outta here!

I  complained about how, knowing nothing specific from HR, it's impossible  to learn from this situation, and I greatly want to. My boss took me  out afterwards and made it clear that it's just he and me having a  private conversation now. He said that he likes me a lot and understands  me, but in the future, I should not put myself out there so  immediately, with people I don't yet know, or who don't yet know me. To  make my intentions clear. This is all good general advice, but is this  likely to solve my situation? No. He then told me that as a manager,  every statement has to be neutral and he could never compliment a man on  his shirt or a woman on her whatever..... THAT's what got me to read  between the lines, and understand what happened.

I  told a baby boomer friend about this a few days later and he acted  all-knowing. He said, ""Oh yeah! You CAN'T do that! Not for about another  5 years, until all of this (I am guessing he is referring to the #metoo  movement)  dies down!""

Well  shit. I knew at the time that with all the sexual harassment was being  reported, that this is a new era. And at the company I was at, at the  time, they started to talk about ""hostile work environments"" and how you don't want to do that. But I didn't think that I could ever be guilty  of creating a hostile work environment, myself.

So  there seems to be new rules for behavior in the workplace, or at least  in the office place. New unspoken, unwritten rules. I did a google  search and I didn't find much. What are these new rules? What can we now  do, that we couldn't before, and what can we now not do anymore (like  complimenting someone on their appearance or clothing or style or  fashion sense) that we used to be able to do?

#MenToo are victims,6,ai9w50,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/ai9w50/mentoo_are_victims/,4,1548075754.0,"I experienced my first sexual harassment encounter in junior high school by a senior of mine‚Äîroughly 9 years ago. We were in active in an extra-curricular organization and I was part of his team. He invited the team to sleepover in his house to prepare for a next day big event. I already knew he was into me so whenever we‚Äôd have any interaction, I‚Äôd be cautious on my actions, words and everything else because I don‚Äôt want to trigger him with any possibility. Then the sleepover night came. After the others had gone to sleep, he forced his way to sleep between myself and another person. I had no choice because I had already fallen asleep. I woke up in the middle of night because I felt something was crawling behind my back. At first, I thought maybe it was a bug or maybe it was just my body hair standing up because it was really cold that night. Then I realized, it was his hand caressing my back from the middle going down to my bum. He was touching me everywhere and I froze because I didn‚Äôt know what was happening and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Then, I felt his hand slowly forcing its way inside by trousers. That‚Äôs when I had the courage to move and stand up. He asked me what happened but I couldn‚Äôt speak. I couldn‚Äôt say anything because he was acting like he didn‚Äôt do anything. I just let it go and slept in another bed. From that day on, I can‚Äôt seem to face this person. I can‚Äôt look at his face and his eyes because all I remember was that night when he had opened my eyes from innocence and looked at everything else in another perspective. I didn‚Äôt know what to do back then. I guess one way I did to cope up with the trauma was to tell my bros. I needed the support from them but it didn‚Äôt really turn out great. Instead of facing the issue, what we did was make fun of that person. Spread what he had done to me to our inner circle which started disgust towards him from us. Even until now, we‚Äôd make fun of our senior whenever anyone would speak about him. A few years later until recently, I‚Äôd see him in parties and night outs and he‚Äôd still try to force his way towards me. He would approach me and would ask me for indecent proposals. He would also slap my butt in public and would just laugh when I‚Äôd give him a face of disgust and contempt. He did it again a few years after that when we came across each other in the beach til then I had the courage to speak up and call him out.

Even after those encounters, I‚Äôd experience something similar whenever they see me drunk in public of whenever I take naps while in transit on public transportations. These people, both binary and non-binary genders, would take advantage of me whether I am sober or drunk. They would make me drink more. Have their arms wrapped around me. Touch me everywhere front and back. After all these things, I just never really of this as a big deal because I didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss out of it. Until I told one of my closest friends what has been happening to me whenever I‚Äôm out partying and drinking. He told me, it‚Äôs how sexual harassment and abuse on men had been normalized. Men would just let these things go because when a man speaks up about this, the society lashes back on them with victim-blaming and masculinity degradation. This shouldn‚Äôt be the case. We are all equal. Men have the same voice as women to speak up about sexual harassment and it shouldn‚Äôt be normalized. Our masculinity cannot be degraded if we have experienced something more or less the same instances but rather we should have the power to act, speak and think without hindrance or restraint. We shouldn‚Äôt be the silenced with the fear of our masculinity being taken away from us.

This is why I‚Äôm starting this thread. I want to tell all the men out there that you are not alone. It‚Äôs time to tell your story. Your stories should be heard too because #MenToo can be and are victims.

"""You asked for it.""",6,ae3dgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/ae3dgc/you_asked_for_it/,2,1547009478.0,"Hey, this is my first time posting on Reddit and decided this was the best first post I could make. This will be a long post and if you take time to read it all thank you! I am a 24 year old female and this is my story. 

Let me start this off by saying that I feel I was sexualized from a young age by rando's, as I call them, and even family members. Before the age of eleven I really thought I was an average kid. I was pretty content with life up until then. My mom was a good mother and did what she could with what she was given. My first encounter with abuse was when my mom forced me to go with my older sister to a party. She wouldn't let her out unless I went. Her logic was she believed if I went my sister wouldn't do anything wrong as I would come home and tell her. But she failed to think of me and what could happen to me. There I was sexually abused. Enough said, it rocked my world. I didn't tell anyone though, I didn't know who this person was and I think I was in shock for a long time. I felt so alone and sank into a deep depression then I began cutting myself. For context, I was also obsessed with boys around this time and had unrealistic fairy tale dreams of what my love life would be like. Which sadly didn't come true. From there I think things just spiraled out of control for me. 

Two years later I became close to my male cousin and it seemed things finally started to get back to normal. Then my older sister got a boyfriend that was eight years older than her. He was a piece of work to say the least. He was about 24 at the time and had already been married before. Quickly he turned into a nightmare. He was always commenting things about my butt and wanted to take pictures together which I refused. He lived with us at one point and I would lock my room every night because I was terrified of what he could do. He was just a huge creep. My sister tried breaking things off when he became verbally abusive and controlling. But he came to my dad and told her he had intercourse with my sister. My dad was very set in his traditional ways back then and told my sister she either married the guy or she couldn't live with us anymore. She eventually married him. But I was happy that he wasn't going to live with us anymore. I felt really bad for her but I was only a kid and my mom had no say otherwise we were all kicked out. So we went on living our lives visiting her every so often.

Another year later I got into my first ""serious relationship."" It seemed serious anyway. He was a sweet guy until he wasn't. A few months into dating he tried to force himself on me and became physically abusive. I didn't leave because he threatened to commit suicide if I did. I was still a teenager and didn't know how to cope. I confided in my male cousin and he told me to just leave him because it wasn't healthy and if he did anything it was not my fault. So I eventually grew the courage and dumped him. I was still cutting and my school noticed so I began counseling there. I never told them what happened though, I was scared of all that could happen. After that *another* year passed and I was finally a freshman and life seemed to be better. Then my sister had a baby. Some time later she asked me to go spend the night with her which I agreed. But as soon as the door to the car shut she told me the plan her husband and her had. Which was to go to a hotel and have me babysit so they could drink. They offered to buy me food if I had one drink. I agreed because I was incredibly stupid, broke, and fast food was something I didn't get often. I couldn't stomach the drink though and they told me I was no fun. Eventually bed time came and mind you they got a room with just one best. I slept on the edge and my niece and sister were in the middle. I felt something touch me in the middle of the night which I was convinced was ghost and called my male cousin to pick me up. He did and I came home sobbing to tell my mom and she was furious. She called my sister and told her she knew it wasn't a ghost and that I was naive. I stopped talking to her for awhile and was forbidden from going to her house. A month or so later my male cousin invited me to his house to watch movies with other cousins of ours. We fell asleep on the couch and I woke up to him groping me, it was disgusting but at this point I had no idea what was going on and wanted it to all be a nightmare. I pushed him away, still pretending to be asleep. The next morning I left and never told anyone what happened. **I know I should have spoke up in all of these situations but at the time it seemed impossible**. 

I was very extroverted at this time in my life and had a lot of friends. At least in the beginning of my freshman year but by the end of my first semester I was being bullied really bad so I switched to online school. I met what would later be my child's father over winter break that year. I never told him what I went through either. He didn't seem to care. He had his own issues and unfortunately we made poor choices and I got pregnant. I'll leave that story for another time. My pregnancy came and went and I came out with a boat load of even more mental issues. As if I needed anymore. I sucked being a mom. My mom raised my son for the first three years. My relationship with this guy, B, was off and on. During the time we were off I had finally reconciled with my older sister, **BAD MISTAKE.**  Again, they invited me to spend the night this time at there house. I agreed and we had some drinks. I drank in high school so this wasn't my first time. Her husband said we were boring as we were playing truth or dare and making ridiculous dares. He suggested we take our clothes off. I outright refused and so did my sister. Shortly after my sister asked if I had every drank and taken pills. I had before so I said yes. She said she had muscle relaxers but I told her I had never mixed alcohol with those but she guilt tripped me so I agreed to taking one. She took one as well. I blacked out some time later. But the last memory I have is of me going to bed with my son and laying him to sleep. Then her husband came in the room and pinned me down and covered my mouth. He began touching my thighs and I got his hand off and screamed for my sister. She came in and told him to leave me alone and left. I remember him leaving my room but honestly, I know what it feels like for me down there after having intercourse. I asked her about it the next day, without mentioning those things. She said she didn't remember and asked her husband. He said I had tried running out at night so he had to hold me down. I don't think that's the truth but I also don't remember. I have been in and out of therapy for seven years and I still can't bring myself to deal with this trauma.

Almost five years ago I went to Mexico for a vacation with family. One of my male cousins actually asked me to send him nudes. I was deeply distraught and told my female cousin and confided in her all that had happened to me and why this triggered me to want to commit suicide. I told my aunt about my cousins request and she was enraged and burst into tears. I also told my parents and they did nothing. **Absolutely nothing**.  Actually, no one did anything. My aunt talked to his mom and they began ignoring me. So yet another severely disappointing event in my life. 

But through all this I met my current partner. He has helped me deal with all the trauma and was the second person I confided in. During this time I had reconciled with my sister as well. While I was in Mexico her husband had been messaging me in an inappropriate matter and I tried telling her but she wrote it off as him being nice. A year later she texted me. In short words she asked me to have sex with her husband as an anniversary gift to him. I told her flat out no. She then offered me money I turned her down again. She asked me not to tell my mom but I had had enough so I did tell her. My mom was angry at first. I finally built the courage to tell her all that I had endured and she refused to believe me. She said I was lying then went on to say if anything happened to me I had asked for it because of the way I dress. I still hate myself sometimes for telling her. Anytime **rape** comes out she blames the victims. My mother believes that no one would be raped if they stayed home. I even asked her about children whose family or friends molest them to which her response was, ""I'm not talking about them."" 

I'm glad I never told her. I have heard so many vile responses from her about what happened to me. But I am upset that I never told anyone. I wish I had reported all of this to police. I sometimes think my sister may have agreed to him possibly raping me the night she suggested we take pills. I hate to think that but I don't know what else to formulate in my head. Sometimes I think I'm crazy. Or that I'm going crazy. I hope this is the year I go back to therapy and deal with all this trauma I have been carrying. Wish me luck.

Once,about 7 years ago I believe I was gangraped, while I was passed out, at a party. My abusive boyfriend pressured me to drink Gin before a party. We sat at the beach as he was in a dark strange mood and he kept pushing me to drink more and more. I took very small sips, I was still very coherent and remember the long drive to the party. When I got there, there were only guys there, as only guys lived there. It was out in the woods at a large house.I was told more people were coming but none ever did. The guy who lived there was a criminal, drug addict/possible dealer who was friends with my abusive ex. His roommate gave me a drink and my ex at the time pressured me into taking half an adderall which I did not want to do. After the drink I blacked out. I remember bits and pieces. I remember going to lay down in the car because I was tired. But I remember being out of the car and later and falling in the bushes.  After that nothing. I woke up the next day in bed at my home which was about an hours drive. My ex said he drove me home cause he ""didn't want me to get raped"" I was covered in bruises all over my legs and burns that looked like cigarette burns. I had pain down there and felt sore, my ex told me that we had had sex after we got home which I had no memory of. I was sick for two days, worse than a normal hangover. I could hardly stand up had an intense headache and severe nausea.My ex didn't leave my side for two days and I felt like he was watching me to make sure I didn't go to the hospital or something. I also was afraid to go and get a drug test because I would test positive for adderral which I did not have a prescription for. I think he knew this would prevent me from getting tested. I believe I was roofied. I do not know if I was raped. I believed at the time he would never do something like that to me. But knowing what I know now, I just do not know. He could have sold me off for a drug debt as my ex was an addict. I am sickened with myself and this horrible memory. I hate myself for not going to the hospital. I hate that I did nothing. I also hate that if I had done something I probably would have been held responsible for taking illegal drugs. I hate our system. I hate that I may run into these who did this to me if I go to visit my hometown and they will laugh because they think I am a stupid whore who they got one over on. I hate that these guys still have friends family who love and support them and I have almost no one. it's fucked up",5,0,meToo,ThePsychoTenenbaums,1,2018-11-18 07:59:17

I went to look at my memories, like I do every day.  Most days, unless I'm watching Firefly, or talking about Pokemon, or cosplay... I don't think about it. I've blocked it out, or tried to. 

I logged into facebook and saw where I mentioned getting shots to someone.  I had to go to the health department and get vaccinations for all the STDs, emergency treatment for two, and I got a pelvic exam. I went to the Health Department to avoid having to show my face at my normal GP.  

That was one of the reasons the police didn't do anything; the Health Department had tampered.

The University of Maine's failure to protect victims!,5,9qr279,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9qr279/the_university_of_maines_failure_to_protect/,0,1540314995.0,"When the University of Maine system was [accused](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/01/31/woman-sues-usm-over-handling-of-alleged-sexual-assaults/) of not investigating two separate cases of a student‚Äôs allegations of rape earlier this year James Thelen the Universities general Counsel sated ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident we have a robust and caring support system in place for victims of sexual assault and that we are fully compliant with Title IX and other legal standards.‚Äù

But does the University have a ‚Äúrobust‚Äù system for Title IX and sex offenses? Statistically speaking one could argue that the answer is no! According to the Bangor Daily News research ‚ÄúSince 2007, the number has steadily risen‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää2017 brought an unprecedented 71 complaints‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut findings that fault the university have remained level, accounting for nearly 10 percent of case outcomes, according to aggregated university data.‚Äù

Why? This depends on who you ask, if you were to ask Chief of human resources officer for the UMaine system Mark Schmelz he would tell you that the increase in allegations is in part by the [\#MeToo movement](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/07/09/news/bangor/umaine-english-professor-cleared-in-harassment-investigation/) but this doesn‚Äôt answer the question of ‚ÄúWhy are abusers not being held responsible?‚Äù Sheri Frasier the Dean of students of The University of Maine Augusta she might say it‚Äôs because ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù have been ‚Äúwinning‚Äù when they get ‚Äúprotection orders‚Äù against abusers and therefore the university does not need to investigate these claims as she told one student ‚ÄúWhy do you care you won.‚Äù

But contrary to their beliefs these claims are not secluded to this year and the investigations have not remained the same throughout the years they have just never been investigated properly. Two such complaints bring merit to this claim one of the most notable of these cases is that of former University of Maine Athletic Director Warren Newton. Warren Newton had been accused of sleeping with a student and was subsequently fired in which he claimed the University ‚ÄúUnlawfully terminated him‚Äù and that that they did not follow their policy and violating his due process rights. Newton would later settle with the University for [$20,000](https://www.pressherald.com/2016/08/10/umaine-system-to-pay-30000-to-settle-lawsuit-by-fired-athletic-director/) and sign a confidentiality agreement.

Less than two years later the University would [fire Jeffery Beanny](https://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/01/former-usm-hockey-coach-sues-university-of-maine-system/) stating that the ‚ÄúUniversity denied his due process rights and did not follow their own policy‚Äù stating that the ‚Äúthe defendants had either already substantiated from an independent investigation, or expected the independent investigation to imminently establish, that he was personally guilty of the accusations set forth in the anonymous letter.‚Äù Beanny much like Newton would later be cleared by head investigator Brenda Haskell‚Äôs who‚Äôs report would then yield the allegation was without merit, and Beaney was innocent Beaney yet is now no longer with the University.

Isolated? No, systematic yes! Even in this year there were two professors who made local news for being accused by multiple students, placed on leave in the spring and subsequently returned to work in the fall only to have one go [back on leave](http://bangordailynews.com/2018/08/30/news/bangor/umaine-english-professor-placed-on-paid-leave-for-second-time-this-year/). These cases don‚Äôt point to the #MeToo movement they point to the University being a ‚Äúrouge‚Äù self-righteous organization not centered around not following the correct procedures.

Whether the university of Maine system wants to admit it has a problem or not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit does, and barring a professor who was supporting and joined by several Maine professors and survivors to advocate against the nomination of a Judge who had been accused by three individuals of rape is not the way to say, ‚ÄúWe stand by survivors!‚Äù Instead what the University needs to do is understand that there is no ‚Äúwinner‚Äù or ‚Äúloser‚Äù in sexual assault and or harassment allegations! There are only victims because regardless of what side you stand on the families, friends, children and entire communities are often ripped apart and forced to deal with unheard-of amount of trauma and restructuring of their views and environments.",5,0,meToo,Michaelkidsmith,1,2018-10-23 20:16:35

Hypocrisy toward the female,6,9ogddp,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9ogddp/hypocrisy_toward_the_female/,10,1539634628.0,"If a man has multiple partners, be it wife or mistress or concubine, in his life or if a guy changes his romantic partners multiple times during his college days, he is called a Stud and that is something considered an honor among most of his peers.

If a woman or a girl does the same, she would be labeled a slut and called many other derogatory names. She would be subjected to such vitriol from people all around that she closes herself emotionally. 

Is sexual freedom a prerogative to men?

Well, I beg to differ. 

The society is such hypocritical that the act which involves both a male and a female is blamed solely on the mindset of a female and her character is judged. While a male goes scot-free, maybe with just a little smudge. 

I honestly do not know much about girls. Up until this point in my life, the count of females I have interacted with does not add up to be more than 15, including the female relatives around my age. 

But recently I have talked to a lot of females on the social medium. And I have pretty much come to know that they wish to be just as free-spirited as anyone can be.   
And that is something which they seem unable to achieve in the real world because of all the restrictions put on them.

That is why I feel that they are keen on escaping to a reality where they are free to be themselves and pour their hearts out. 

The big draw to the virtual social world is Anonymity. They feel safe behind the shield, which is being anonymous.

Anonymity guards them against all the insecurities and oppressions they have faced all their lives.

It is a utopia that they yearn for. The utopia that always is far from being a reality for them. 

The day when the Sun shines his light on a world where masculinity holds the feminine at a higher plane of living in both their hearts and the streets, the world will know true tranquility. The perfect balance the God intended when he made both the male and the female.

Final Words:

I am not encouraging promiscuity in any manner with my words.
I am just stating that the female gender is always limited by being chained to the customs. And all the while, the male goes around doing what he feels like ( not every male) and just dusts off every accusation as if they have the Prerogative to do whatever they want to.

My site is [www.thewordforthis.com](http://www.thewordforthis.com/) and includes associated social channels.

I'm figuring it out as I go along, with the help of some amazing friends and family.

Murky Consent in High School,5,9iv4gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9iv4gc/murky_consent_in_high_school/,2,1537902824.0,"When I was in high school, I took my girlfriends virginity while she was visiting me over a break. She was staying at my house, sleeping in my room, and I put a lot of pressure on her to do it. We broke up shortly after that. It was senior year. I thought at the time that it was consensual, but she called me several months later to express how traumatized (my words) she was by the experience.

I haven't spoken to her in 20 years. I suspect she's blocked me on social media, because even though we have many mutual friends, she doesn't come up in searches, or show up as a friend of a friend. Now, with everything that has come up in the past year around #metoo and particularly the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation, I find myself thinking of her frequently.

I've talked about the event in therapy, and also with my wife. I look back on it as my biggest mistake. It's the action I'm most ashamed of in my life and the thing I regret more than anything. I worry about the effect it's had on her life.

My question is: what now? Should I reach out to her and apologize (something I didn't do at the time), or should I leave things as they are? I don't want to bring up past trauma for her if she's moved on, but I worry that the Kavanaugh hearings have the same effect on her, and maybe an acknowledgment and apology would help her have closure.

TL;DR: I coerced my girlfriend into sex 20 years ago, and I don't know if I should apologize to her now.

Has #MeToo gone too far? The Tom Frieden Forcible Touching Debate,7,9a1qqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9a1qqn/has_metoo_gone_too_far_the_tom_frieden_forcible/,19,1535148965.0,"Today I saw Tom Frieden trending on Twitter. I was surprised to see it was about the former [CDC Director Tom Frieden arrested in New York, accused of forcibly touching woman](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/24/ex-cdc-director-accused-forcibly-touching-woman/?utm_source=onesignal&utm_campaign=pushnotify&utm_medium=push) because I didn't think he would be arrested.

**Must watch** ...[ON AIR: Discussing the charges against Frieden with @kshaughnessy2](https://twitter.com/MylesMill/status/1033028948458975232).

Not going to lie, the storyline is a bit odd to me for the following reasons:

* He has known this woman for 30 years  and a well known family friend
* She was alone with him in his home
* He is married with children and it seems odd to me a woman is alone with a married man with children
* Note üì∑ to guys: If you're not steady dating  or married to her... don't have her in your place alone, without witnesses. You're honestly setting yourself up for her word against yours. Not worth it. What's worse is that he has known this woman for decades.

I honestly feel this was an affair gone wrong... she catches feelings and decides to get him in trouble during the #MeToo Era. He did grope her but  we do not know the circumstances  or why she was in his home. ‚Äã

Something isn't adding up to me... but I doubt this will interfere with his career as this is non-work-related.

My First Male Client as a Newly Licensed Esthetician Nearly Ruined My Career,6,8urbyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8urbyr/my_first_male_client_as_a_newly_licensed/,4,1530258148.0,"I had just graduated from Esthetician school - 27 years old, kinda late, but illness and family obligations had kept me from pursuing a career until then. 

I interviewed for the position of staff esthetician at a salon/spa/beauty supply retail store and it went brilliantly. They promised perks to me that seemed just too good to be true (and they turned out to be - of course they weren‚Äôt going to take on marketing my services as their personal responsibility lol) but since I had yet to take my licensing tests I worked retail first while I took the time to study and eventually pass my pair of licensing exams and eventually was officially employed as the only esthetician and facial service provider on site. 

Clients were few and far between in the first month or two and marketing was difficult to do myself - the marketing strategies they had promised me upon my interview were suddenly thrust upon me and I did my best with what I had available to me. And finally, one day, a salon stylist had successfully referred a male client of hers to me. 

This male client‚Äôs introduction to me began with him saying ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind letting her take over my other girl‚Äôs job.‚Äù Before asking my name and replying with his, he was shaking my hand and patting me on the back - continuing to go on about how the stylist who was referring him to me told him I give an excellent massage. 

Neck, shoulder, arm and hand massage is part of my facial service but the salon stylists had ‚Äúcoerced‚Äù me into accepting $10 per massage from them when they told me that they needed it by reminding me I didn‚Äôt have a clientele and, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious you need the money anyway. this way we have a reason to refer you to our clients!‚Äù

So here I was, leading this man into my spa suite. He kept insisting I give him a full body massage - which was not on my menu. I‚Äôm not a licensed massage therapist, I kept telling him, but I am a licensed esthetician - so I offered him a back facial. He kept insinuating ‚ÄúYou can call it whatever you want as long as you give me a good massage‚Äù which after some time I had to just outright ignore. My GM was out for lunch, leaving me feeling a little cornered at that moment in time. 

So I went ahead and initiated the back facial service by instructing him to undress to his comfort - shirt and shoes off, slacks on and get under the sheet while I moved to exit for privacy. 

He told me to stay. He blocked the door from me. I backed away, keeping focus on my consultation and skin analysis sheet in front of me and from my peripheral I could see him removing his underwear and hooking them up along with the rest of his clothes. ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind - I‚Äôm much more comfortable this way you know. And since you do waxing I wanted to ask you if you‚Äôd be able to do what my last wax girl was able to do for me ‚Äî‚Äú to which I finally managed to cut him off and instruct him to cover himself on the bed face down. If he wanted to get a Brazilian wax, I told him, we would have to schedule one. 

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt need one today.‚Äù 
So I dropped it. 

I performed the 70 minute back facial as professionally as I could possibly muster as he told me stories about his messy divorce and how big of a bitch his ex wife was. He asked me a couple times if I had ever been to the British Virgin Islands and how I seemed like I would enjoy it myself - ‚ÄúBest massages on the beach you can get in the world‚Äù he said ‚ÄúAnd a pretty girls like you deserve it. I wasted it on that bitch ex wife of mine.‚Äù

He kept insisting I extend the massage part of the service lower and would scoot up on the bed to expose his bare ass to me which I would discreetly re cover. But then finally it was done. I helped him sit up and cover himself and told him to get dressed 

But then he dropped the sheet and asked me to come closer. ‚ÄúI just want to show you what my wax lady used to do for me before she moved to see if you think you could do it yourself when I need it done.‚Äù

He just stood there, blocking my escape, holding his penis in his hand and telling me to get down and take a look to see if I understood what he meant. I kept insisting ‚Äúsir, it‚Äôs only been 2 weeks since your last wax it‚Äôs still in very good shape and it will still be an easy template to follow in another 2 weeks if you set up an appointment this really isn‚Äôt necessary‚Äù

But he just kept demonstrating until he finally had to leave for another appointment. He made me stay in the room as he redressed. I followed him out. He didn‚Äôt tip me. 

I confined in the only authority figure in the building at the time that I would not be comfortable servicing him again and she asked why. So I summarized it and she laughed so hard she doubled over. By the end of the week, everyone in the store knew about it and all agreed it was the funniest story they had ever heard. 

2 weeks later came, and he was coming in for his walk in wax. I crouched beneath the salon desk and begged my GM to tell him I‚Äôm not available, and she let me hide outside while he got his hair done. 

She came outside to meet me, though, and told me that she was ok covering for me that time - but explained that because I wasn‚Äôt able to stand up for myself, i missed out on a $65 service. I wasn‚Äôt making enough money for commission, and sometimes we all have to do things we don‚Äôt want to do. 

I left that chain not long after. I didn‚Äôt work hard enough for them - and in all honesty I didn‚Äôt. Because everyone‚Äôs favorite story to tell was about the man who got naked for his service with the quiet and shy new lesbian esthetician and how that was probably the first penis she had ever seen WHAT A LAUGH!",6,0,meToo,lamiales,1,2018-06-29 10:42:28

For everyone else it doesn't matter what I say because it will be taken out of context anyway.

That being said, I believe it is also being used as a tool to attack innocent people and is setting a disturbing precedent that anyone accused is guilty until proven innocent. I was reading about Danny Masterson getting fired once he was accused and was flabbergasted. What happened to due process of law? If all it takes is a group of accusers to ruin a persons reputation and livelihood without any kind of evidence or investigation then how is this any different from the salem witch hunts? One person was so adamant that everyone accused is automatically guilty they said that my assertion that some of them might be innocent was the stupidest thing they had ever read. I mean really?

Advise on sexual harassment handled by corrupt private school,7,8p5vll,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8p5vll/advise_on_sexual_harassment_handled_by_corrupt/,3,1528331425.0,"Today is a sweet day for the bitter system. Democracy has finally come together to work at its finest. In a system corrupted by the political agenda for several decades, there is maybe a glimmer of hope. The people of California voted to remove the Judge, Aaron Persky, who sentenced Stanford rapist, Brock Turner, only 6 months in prison (getting out early on ‚Äúgood behavior‚Äù I might add). The rapist assaulted an unconscious woman outside by a dumpster at his frat, before being tackled and subdued by two guys passing by, with a potential of 14 years in prison for the crimes he committed, was sentenced to only 6 MONTHS. So yeah, that shit stings. But today that judge is unemployed! He has no idea was justice is, what pain is, and what trauma is, because he created so much more agony for Emily Doe. Basically a complete moron at his job. 

But I would like to raise a point out there for those of you still scratching your heads as to why rape victims don‚Äôt speak up. This entire case is reason alone is why a lot of girls don‚Äôt get help when they are raped or assaulted, because the one place that is suppose to help them, the system, basically screws them too. 

A personal testimony:

8 years ago when I was in 8th grade, I was in art class cleaning my paint brushes because it was nearing the end of the period. I turn around and this guy was standing right over me. FYI I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1 now, and was probably smaller back then. I also lived in the desert which will be important in a moment. Anyhow, I had worn UGG slippers that day because that was the style back then and had tried pushing him away with my foot because I had paint and water all over my hands. It made an ashy mark because it was dry and winter time. Because of that he justified grabbing by breasts. I obviously yelled something like ‚Äúget off‚Äù or ‚Äúhe just grabbed my boob‚Äù, either way I yelled. All of my classmates saw, the teacher was in the classroom. It was humiliating. Right when that happened the head of middle school came in, whom I also have had previous issues with. 

In 6th grade I had received an anonymous email telling me to kill myself because I had no friends, my family hated me besides my brother, and he would be the only on to miss me. I showed my mom these emails and she immediately contacted the school, and later I found out contacted the authorities. This same man who came into the classroom after I was sexually harassed handled the emails, but actually did nothing but have a grade wide seminar on bullying. I was still amongst the same girls whom brutally bullied me. 

Back to 8th grade. The head of middle school had come in right when I started yelling and intervened. The next class I was called to the counselors. At this point I didn‚Äôt think I was in trouble, I actually thought they were going to do something good, but no. This student who harassed me in front of my peers was already sitting in the room. I walked in and sat down. They asked me what happened and I told them. The student originally told them I kicked him in the shin and in retaliation he grabbed my breasts. And I told them I had pushed him away with my UGG SLIPPER. He unfortunately had really ashy skin from the climate and left a white mark. They then informed me that both our acts were justified and nothing would happen. My parents weren‚Äôt notified, his weren‚Äôt. Nothing. Just brushed under the rug. Basically telling me him grabbing my breasts was my fault. Confirming he was actually justified. 

Years later, I see how that one instance altered my entire life. I was raped the next year by a 20 year old. At a very young age power‚Äôs opinion and influence was stained in my mind and I didn‚Äôt go to the authorities. I wasn‚Äôt the only one, I wouldn‚Äôt be the only one, and was taught at a young age it would always be justified no matter how stupid the reason is. I couldn‚Äôt tell my parents because, to this day, they are highly religious and conservative. I now have PTSD from my time at that school. I had to drop out of college because my anxiety attacks would happen in any classroom situation. I have social anxiety and can‚Äôt trust anyone. My entire body at one point was completely covered in eczema. I felt like I had no other option. 

Now, I‚Äôm struggling to move on from the entire experience and wish a little justice could be served to this school. My life is ruined because of it and it‚Äôs so hard to feel okay even doing basic activities to progress in life.

Does anyone have any advise/should I legally do anything??

The school as a positions of authority created an extremely hostile, unsafe environment for me on multiple occasions. It taught me corrupt life lessons, and influenced other students disgusting behavior. 

Another thing to note is that I went to a private school at the time of the attack. I know laws are different for private vs. public. ",7,0,meToo,jhumptyhump,1,2018-06-07 03:30:25

An interesting experience on getting others to share my concern about creeping in my club.,6,8jj2x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8jj2x1/an_interesting_experience_on_getting_others_to/,3,1526361105.0,"So I'm in a hobbyist club of about 250 people, of a range of ages.     We have regular IRL meetings.

There's this guy that's been hitting on every young girl that shows up since I first met him 8 years ago.  He's well spoken and older, but fairly handsome.    I'll confess I found his predictability slightly amusing.    

But I since found out it's gone beyond that, that some members have had specifically bad experiences with him, some are distressed and uncomfortable in his presence.

Then the guilt sets in that I am slightly complicit in this.

So I approach the club's exec, express my concerns about the individual, and ask that we put a harassment policy in place.

I had to pull teeth to get replies, but the 3 exec members I wrote eventually revealed these positions:

1) One found the exercise completely unnecessary, dismissing it as some hippie bullshit.

2)  One kept citing legal liability of a club policy, and seemed more interested in quibbling than finding a way.

3)  One sensible response:   They were cautious about my accusations, but open to discussing the creating of  guidelines.

I thought this would be self-evidently a good thing.   Perhaps my approach was a bit brash and pushed them away.   I thought it would go much easier.   The resistance I'm experiencing is completely unexpected.


Me, I'm fairly privileged, and honestly, am accustomed to my ideas being automatically well accepted and doors being automatically opened.    But this door stuck as I was barging through it.    A bit jarring and thought provoking!

Even though as i start typing i know it won't be.

I remember waking one morning after my typical binge drinking session to my girlfriend telling me she never  ever wanted me to behave that way again. 

Sex was always an issue for us, i have a low sex drive and it has proven to be very difficult to get over in the relationships i've had, both then and since. 

I'm not sure what transpired that night but i keep having a growing memory of me being inappropriate and maybe forceful with her. i say maybe as i was extremely drunk and this memory has come back to me after many many years. We never once spoke about this afterwards. 

We continued our relationship for many years afterwards and sex became the reason we split. I simply could not see the person i loved dearly upset to the extent she was. I was upsetting the person i loved and it broke my heart. Since the split she has gone to marry have a family and be a success in her field. I believe her to be really happy with her family and husband and hope that's true. I wish all the happiness in the world. I let her go so she could be happy. I saw enough tears. 

We split because my desire reached a low where we hadn't had sex for many months. Of our ten year relationship perhaps we only had sex once in the last year. It was too much, we didn't know how to deal with it and i couldn't cope causing her so much pain. Simultaneously i believed there was little i could do about it as it seemed to me this was my natural state and was unlikely to ever change. Very little has changed in that regard for me.

In some aspects we miss each other. We aren't friends now, the husband and i would never see eye to eye and due to this and my travelling we've never been in each others company since our split. We have sporadic contact which has been warm, friendly even but distant due to other circumstance.

I feel absolutely devastated and sick at the thought of my forcing myself on her. I want to acknowledge this with her. I wish to write her and apologize.

I understand that, according to my fractured and definitely unreliable memory, what occurred that night is wrong.

I understand and acknowledge that what I did could be devastating to a person and in her silence she may have been suffering and probably was.

I am sorry. 

 I have never displayed this behavior since, no matter how drunk. 

My drunkenness is mentioned to allow you to understand how this memory of mine has taken so long to come to the fore. I acknowledge and understand that i may have also been hiding it from myself.

Drunkenness is not an excuse.

I could go on but everything i try to put into words sounds like i am excusing myself. I am not. I wish to make amends.

I open up to this community to gauge reaction. I wish to become more accountable for past actions in order to become a better person. I am not somebody that inflicts pain but having put a lot of thought into why i find myself so so down and low on confidence and self worth i have to address those things i have done wrong in my life. Should my memory serve me correctly then this is by far the worse thing i have done to a woman. Other than that i have cheated, ghosted and been callous. 

I am new to the internet after sheltering myself away from everything and everyone i've ever been close to. This has left me a bit of a mess and i now wish to be happy and cannot do this without fronting up.

I'll endeavor to be involved in this thread should it generate replies as too many times in my life i have upped, left and not been present.

In general i would describe myself as respectful of women. I have however not been respectful to a number of my partners, i see there a clear difference even though all but one of my partners have been women. Of course this last sentence sounds like bullshit. 

The only man i ever have been sexually involved with was a horny fumble in the moment which was born out of being high and curious to see if i had just been denying i was gay. I am not gay however i am not opposed to being with a man, in my opinion if you fancy them then go for it no matter the label tacked onto them.


should i write her?

Me Too affecting my sex life,6,848ds9,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/848ds9/me_too_affecting_my_sex_life/,3,1520980569.0,"Content warning: sexual trauma, descriptions of sexual interactions 

Hi there, I'm a sexual trauma survivor, and I've found in the last few months since the start of the Me Too movement that it's sort of drastically affected my sex life. I mean, my assault has previously affected my sex life, but not to this extent. Being reminded of it constantly and hearing about other people's horrible experiences has made it a lot harder for me to want to have sex, and when I do want to have sex, it has drastically changed what that sex looks like. 

I'm a writer, and I think this is an important topic for discussion, so I'm writing about this issue. I'd like to talk to other survivors who also feel their sex lives have been changed or affected by Me Too. I'm looking to talk to other people who have changed their sex lives -- either through changing their techniques during sex, or the place or time they have sex -- to make room for their own sexual trauma. 

I'll give an example from my own experience. I personally have been much less interested in penetrative sex over the last few months, as the result of the Me Too movement and what happened during my sexual assault. There are also certain positions in which I prefer to be touched by my partner that make me feel more in control. Our sex also doesn't look ""normal"" -- sometimes I am the focus of the stimulation and he is involved or stimulated minimally. (Yes, this triggers feelings of guilt, because as a queer woman who grew up predominantly having sex with men, I feel like I should be servicing him equally or more than myself.) 

But I think all of this is worth discussing. I think Me Too (and the Aziz Ansari story) are changing our conversations about what sex looks like and what consent is. And I think talking about trauma and how we change our sex accordingly is a crucial part of that conversation. If you're interested in talking with me about your personal experiences and how you're making room for trauma in your sex life, PM me. 

Mods, if this is a problem, I'm sorry, but I do think it falls under the description of ""bringing to attention to the issue of various unwanted sexual experiences, regardless of gender, age, race, wealth, social, or legal status,"" and the effects of those experiences.",6,0,meToo,jobeatrice3,1,2018-03-14 01:36:09

My sexual abuse story.,8,7row7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7row7k/my_sexual_abuse_story/,1,1516431327.0,"My story starts in a pretty grey area. I was in the beginning a willing participant in what transpired but later regretted ever meeting the person in question. I like many people enjoy bdsm, power play and a few years ago frequented a website that specialized in that ""kind of thing"". One day I received a message from a handsome older man who claimed to be a dominant and wanted to meet and take me out to dinner. Ill preface this by saying I am an adult so meeting a stranger in a public place for a meal was not strange too me. We exchanged messages for a few days and I decided to meet up with him. The lunch was nice, he picked a local resturant that was in a good neighborhood, imediantly giving me a feeling of comfort. The meal wrapped up and he asked me if I would like to come home with him, I agreed because he was charming and like I said quite attractive. When we got to his house everything changed, his demeanor , his tone, basically his entire personality. The charming man I had lunch with was gone. He ordered me inside and barked commands at me, at first I was exhilirated by this but had a feeling in the back of my mind that something was off. I regret to say that I wasn't strong enough, or maybe I was to afraid to refuse him for the next portion of the story. I was walked into his room and my purse, phone and keys were put on a shelf. He directed me to a small room off of his bedroom, in this room there was a large square ottoman, an enormous mirror and in the corner a camera on a tripod. I immediately felt uncomfortable but he shut the doors and pushed me onto the ottoman. The next part of the story in sure I don't need to go into details but it happened and the whole time I cried and stared at myself in the mirror. When he was done he got up, threw my clothes at me and told me to get dressed.  He said to me "" I bet that was the best fuck of you life"" I cringed at those words and just said "" uh huh"" he slapped me. "" you stupid little bitch,  tell me that was the best fuck of your life"" this was the point when I realized this wasn't the average kinky fun sex I was used to. I stood up and told him that I had to meet my roommate and that he knew where I was ( which was a lie). I grabbed my purse and he looked shocked that I wanted to leave. My bullshit excuse worked , I think mainly because I said my roommate was a male. I got in my car shaking and drove home. That night I googled him. Three counts of aggravated assault against a woman, 1 count of domestic violence and 1 arrest for battery. This man had children. This man worked as a cook for an elderly couple. This man could have killed me. I wish I could say this was the end of the story... It was the end of my encounter with this pos but someone I knew personally wouldn't be as lucky as me. She also found her self in the hands of my abuser and she didn't come out unscathed. Her date ended with him pushing her down a flight of stairs and punching her in the face. This resulted in his arrest but I know he is still out there today praying on young stupid girls like me.    I have been afraid to tell my story.... Tried to put it out of my mind but I feel its essential to say that even of something starts consensually it can very quickly change and its still Sexual abuse. It still counts.

Metoo at work but not at home?,5,7fsb8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7fsb8g/metoo_at_work_but_not_at_home/,6,1511754209.0,"I get it. Sexual harassment and/or assault at work. Been there. Done that. Don't want to talk about it. I actually thought it was normal to be honest especially dealing with it in a male dominated industry. I have a right to not be sexually harassed at work and I have found ways to deal with it.

What I don't understand is why I see hundreds of websites telling me if my husband wants sex I better just do it anyway. If I don't my marriage is headed for ruins. Don't withhold sex from him etc. Ignore my needs for rest and sleep and just let him have what he needs. Never mind that I just worked 10+ hours plus 3 hours of commuting, getting up extra early to deal with household then came home and on top of everything made dinner and dealt with garbage and recycling. So ya. I don't feel like sex. My alarm goes off in 5 freaking hours to do this all again and therapists say I should just give my husband sex because thats what men need for intimacy?

Men can't sexually harass women at work but therapists and doctors seem to think women should be sexually harassed jn marriage?

He said that positions in the company were scarce and that only one of us could remain in our position. Nick dismissed Steven, as soon as the door shut he put his cold hand on my shoulder and said ""If you want to stay at this position, little hatchling, you will do as I say"" I tried to escape his grip but his powerful, bear-like grasp held me in my place.

#metoo,6,79gcpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/79gcpw/metoo/,0,1509282038.0,"I never shared this with anyone because, at the time, it didn't seem like it was what it actually was to me. I took it as a couple of guys being dicks and fucking around. As I got older, I learned that it was sexual harassment, it wasn't guys being dicks.  They were sexually harassing me.

I used to volunteer at an emergency medical service squad when I was 19. I was in EMT school at the time when I joined this squad. A guy there, roughly a year younger than me, told his buddies he had a crush on me. From that point on, his buddies harassed me to go on a date with this kid and help him lose his virginity. Nearly every time I worked at the squad, I was teased and taunted about this kid's interest in me. 

Things started to slowly escalate when they added #hazing to the #sexualharassment One day, I was hog tied and placed on a pool table, by the same guys who harassed me over this kid, then brought him to the room and told him to, ""Go for it."" Thankfully the kid had a heart and demanded to have me untied. Instead, the guys carried me down the stairs, still tied up, brought me to a bedroom, untied me, then handcuffed me to the bed. They then pushed the kid in the room and said to him, as they locked the door on us, ""You're not coming out until you're no longer a virgin."" Again, thankfully this kid had a heart and didn't proceed with this nonsense. Somehow he got us out of the room and me out of the handcuffs. 

When I left the squad to pursue college, I wrote in my resignation letter everything that happened to me. I was beside myself that no one called me to talk to me about what I wrote. I never pressed charges. I never sought out a lawyer. I just left. Never to return again. 

It's a shame that at 19 years old I had endured what I did, being naive and all, not knowing any better at the time what exactly was going on. Now I know, and knowing is half the battle. #metoo ",6,0,meToo,targaryen0312,1,2017-10-29 16:00:38

me too,5,773p38,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/773p38/me_too/,2,1508294183.0,"Girl is in middle school. Mom calls her over in the middle of the night to listen to her dad speaking to another women on the phone through the bathroom door. 
Girl tries to forget what she heard, pretend it wasn't real. Dad still drives her to school every morning. Girl takes dad‚Äôs phone on the way to school one day and changes her mom's name to ""sue my love"" in his phone. Dad scolds her for doing that. Girl tries to pretend it doesn't mean anything.

Girl wakes up in the middle of the night to her mom screaming at her dad to get out of the house. Girl doesn't see her dad again for the next year. Mom tells girl not to tell her friends about anything. Girl doesn't know how to lie to her friends when they ask where her dad is. Girl just says ""I dont know"".
Girl finally tells friends a year later, writes in a little corner on a page of a notebook that dad has left and parents are divorced, and friend sees it and texts girl immediately, ""why didn't you tell me about your parents?"" 
And mom sees the phone first. And she asks why girl's friends know. And she's upset that everyone will find out now. And girl wishes mom didn't see phone. And wishes she didn't tell friends so mom wouldn't be upset.

A year later. Mom is dating guys. It's weird for girl to see mom with so many different men. That aren't her father. That she doesn't know. Or trust or love. And aren't good enough for her mother. Girl's sister is okay with it, but she is not. Girl throws a fork at her sister one night. She still regrets it.

Girl gets a boyfriend. He seems nice and fun. And helps distract the fact that mom has a boyfriend. But he seems cool. We both have boyfriends. We both are distracted. Mom lets us stay out late all summer and doesn't ask questions. But I don't want to have anything to hide. I don't want to stay out late. Or have my boyfriend stay over my house until 3am. Undressing me and molesting me while I pretend to be asleep, hoping that he would go home. Waking up in the morning unsure if what happened the night before was real. Because I couldn't believe he would do such things.

Girl continues to date boy for 4 more months. Boy never pressures girl into having sex while she's ""awake"". Boy continues to sexually abuse girl while she's ‚Äúasleep‚Äù. 

Girl finally breaks up with boy over the phone without explanation. She's too embarrassed to give one. Boy accuses girl of falling for someone else. Girl's family is upset with her and feels bad for boyfriend. Family continues to invite ex over to hang out for next 4 years. 

Girl tries to move on. Tries to date other guys. Girl can't get close to anyone. Girl breaks it off before things could get intimate. Girl develops a sleep disorder. Girl becomes physically paralyzed upon waking from sleep. Girl can't move or act out or act up or speak up. Girl can't react to someone dominating her or forcing her against her will. Girl deals with sleep paralysis for the next 6 years. 

Girl moves to a new city. Girl meets a girl. Who makes her feel safe. But who doesn't feel the same way. Girl meets another girl, and tries to feel safe again. It doesn't work at first. Girl is triggered into feeling how she did 4 years ago. Girl screams and pushes consenting non-predator away from her, a delayed reaction perhaps.

Girl seeks help. Girl begins therapy. Girl moves away, and stays with consenting partner. Girl works to overcome all that has happened. Girl finally confronts ex about his trauma-inducing abuse. He is dumbfounded but unapologetic. Sleep paralysis declines. Girl learns to fully trust partner. Girl may never be fully healed. But continues to heal.

Thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to work in this position for the past 2 years.¬†¬†Ive greatly enjoyed and appreciated the time I‚Äôve spent here and am thankful for the opportunity to work as an acting AGM for so long here in ________.¬†¬†Because of our lack of proper leadership and not so stellar management hires over the last 2 years I've taken over many duties and responsibilities and learned a great deal of knowledge which I will continue to carry with me and apply throughout my career.¬†¬†

Although the time I spent with this company was less than ideal because of the circumstances, I appreciate the experiences I've had in ________ and the doors that you've opened for me with this relocation.

Unfortunately, in light of recent events, I've decided that this company‚Äôs actions go against my own personal core values and I've decided to step down because of the following reasons.¬†¬†Its been nearly 2 years and I‚Äôve been waiting for my review for a raise which I was told would be after 1 year.¬†¬†The head of operations visits our location a few times a year and only speaks to the GM because no one else matters to him.¬†¬†I submitted my request for a very important family vacation in May, but because of a technical issue it was not received by Paylocity.¬†¬†I injured my leg, and the PTO for my injury was taken before the PTO for my vacation, even though my vacation was submitted first.¬†¬†I‚Äôm also being documented for the first time in my career for not submitting my PTO when I was injured, even though I said multiple times I was having technical issues and wanted it done for me on the office end.

On multiple occasions our staff has been robbed but cameras are never investigated, staff has been begging for gratuity for large parties because of the constant teenagers/children/tourists not tipping to no avail, so the overall sentiment of the staff toward Corporate is that ‚ÄúThey Dont Care‚Äù.¬†¬†Since there‚Äôs no HR for this company for the last 2 years, there aren't proper channels to voice important concerns regarding staff issues, so everyone goes unheard and problems fester and grow.¬†¬†

Now the company has decided to fire a young lady for ‚Äútheft‚Äù after she was served multiple drinks at the bar after the restaurant was closed, and was left to walk home alone and unfortunately get sexually assaulted and ended up in the hospital for over a week.¬†¬†The lack of sensitivity for this rape case in this political climate is astounding and disappointing, and these circumstances prove to me once and for all that ________ does not care about its management, and even less about its employees.

I will ensure a smooth wrap-up of my duties and will be sure to stay in the game until the very end and assist with my transition out.¬†¬†During my last few weeks here I will do everything possible to get the remainder of my projects streamlined and train our team members for the coming summer, please let me know if I can be of any further assistance during this transition.¬†¬†I wish the company continued success, and hope all the work I‚Äôve done over the last 16 months here in ________________ has helped create a better work environment and move the needle forward.¬†¬†

Thank you for all your guidance, I wish you all the best and look forward to keeping in touch and visiting as a guest in the future.

The young lady who I referenced to came back to work happy and ready to move on with her life.  She was then fired for not paying for her drinks when she was drinking after registers were closed and doors were locked.  The bartender who overserved her and did not charge after restaurant hours kept his job for over a week before he was reported., even though the GM knew what he did.  

The management allowed her to stumble out of the restaurant at 12:30am alone, and she was taken by an older man to a hotel room nearby and violated for 6 hours.

This company has no heart, and I hope they get everything they deserve for doing this to this poor girl.  ",4,0,meToo,Juancho511,1,2019-03-23 20:34:35
A story from my childhood,6,b2inqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b2inqx/a_story_from_my_childhood/,2,1552915229.0,"If you get triggered by incest and rape, don't worry I am too, but you should probably stay and listen to the story I've been silent about. 

I remember some details more vividly than others and I am sorry about that.

When I was about 8, me and my family went to visit family. The family consisted of my uncle, my aunt, and their 13 year old son. It has been so long that I've forgotten all thier names. The journey to was fun, the trip itself was rather alright until we insert the 13 year old cousin, let's call him Red. Red was an alright kid, he's done good in school, all the basic stuff. He was pretty nice to me and my siblings. He sometimes snuck us snacks at midnight so we hung out with him. In the end, pretty cool dude.

After a few days, we were chilling out in the guest room and our parents went out to go do whatever adults do together. Red says ""Hey OP, I'm learning a new dance move, want me to show you?"" I was obsessed with dance because of exercise videos my mom and I did at the time so she could try and lose weight. I thought maybe I could teach it to her so why not? We went to his room and he sat on the bed. I went to sit next to him and he told me to sit on his lap. Being 8, I wasn't hesitant at all. I sat facing him.

Me: What now, Red?

Red: Move back and forth

I obviously complied and I just looked at him, confused, I didn't understand what purpose this would serve in the dance. He looked really happy though so I just kept doing it. I don't know what was happening in his mind but when I opened my mouth, he just kissed me. Dead on the lips. I was horrified. I was saving my kisses for all the cute boys in my grade. However, I went with it. I didn't realize the dance didn't exist. I actually didn't realize until I remembered that trip last year, as I am 13, and it's kinda fricked me over.

After kissing me, he just lost the little control he had left and went just full on rape mode. I was so confused, was this part of the dance? I just let him do it. I didn't know it was wrong. Why would I stop him from dancing with me? I thought stopping him would be rude, even though I was extremely uncomfortable with how this was for me.

Red; after just finishing: Did you like it?

Me: I don't know how I would teach that to my mom

Red: You can't 

Me: Why?

Red: You just can't

So I didn't.

It's not like I can tell her, because she wouldn't believe me, even if I wanted her to. Since she kinda has it out for me now. We have cut contact with that family I believe, because I don't really remember them very well.

Anyway, that's one of my #metoo stories, almost tearing up as I write this, thanks for reading, this won't be my last post on this sub reddit.

Later in the night i woke up to him on top of me, fucking me, which then progressed to him having anal sex with me. I remember telling him no and to stop but he didn't.

He (B) would often stare at me and smile in a creepy way, was too touchy.
Fast foward to when we all go home with a taxi: i was sitting next to (B) because he sat down next to me, and my dad sat next to him, my brother in a third back row and (A) was in the passengers seat.

My company shows favoritism towards the man who assaulted me,5,axgz7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/axgz7z/my_company_shows_favoritism_towards_the_man_who/,2,1551760453.0,"Hi everyone. I had originally posted this in a different group, but I‚Äôm not sure if it was the most accurate one to post to.

I‚Äôve been working in outside sales with the same company since April 2017. I won a trip through my work to go to Miami with other coworkers and my top client. One night, I went out with my client who got completely drunk and groped me under my dress, grabbed my bare breast. Now this client is well aware that I am married and when I pulled his hand away, he proceeded to still try to come on to me, saying ‚Äúcome on...can‚Äôt you separate the physical from emotional?‚Äù As you could imagine, I left right then, went back to my room, feeling completely violated.

When I got back from the trip, I immediately informed my HR office about everything. When I met with the president of my company, he told me that this is a tough situation because that specific client is our top account and has been buying from our company for the past 25 years. He took me off of the account because he wants to make sure I am safe but also said ‚ÄúEven if you feel comfortable serving the account still, I don‚Äôt want him to feel uncomfortable.‚Äù

After I reported the incident, I noticed a lot of change in the way the higher ups act towards me. For example, we had a yearly award ceremony in December & I happened to be the highest grossing sales consultant of 2018 as well as the newest employee. I received no congratulations of any kind, but watched as other coworkers who had not had as much success paraded up one by one to receive awards. I‚Äôve also hit sales goals in 2019 which local excursions were offered. I am no longer invited to these because the client that assaulted me is always there. Something doesn‚Äôt feel right.

I keep telling myself that I shouldn‚Äôt look for praise and that I should just be happy that I am growing my territory and making money without that account. I just feel defeated in a way. I used to love my job, and I still love the job in the sense that I can make my own schedule. But I almost don‚Äôt want to sell anything for this company any longer. I work mostly by myself and with my direct boss one day a week. My direct boss is another one of the reasons that I‚Äôve stayed. When I told my direct boss about all of this, he was ready to go and knock the client out. He now takes care of that account.

So my question is, am I being foolish staying here? Is it normal for me to feel this way?",5,0,meToo,,1,2019-03-05 07:34:13

During one of our conversations, we mentioned that #MeToo movement and I mentioned that although the movement is legitimate, it can be abused by the wrong men or women. And that I wouldn't want to have to hug a girl one day and then find her reporting me the next. She seemed to have taken offense to that, but we carried on our friendship.

A week later, she asked me to drop by her new place, and sleep over. I had come in from the bar with friends and I had a few drinks (she was sober) and attempted to kiss her, and she push me back. So I backed out and just went to bed.

The next morning, she kicked me out of her house. I complied because I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable. A couple of hours later, she sent me a text message mentioning the following:

&#x200B;

""You pulled a Bill Cosby on me. What I should do is defame you and ruin your reputation on every single social media medium there is. You could have raped me, but I was passed out and I felt your body against mine. I am asking for 8000 dollars if you wish for me not to mention anything to the press, social media, your friends and family, and the police. I will write a detailed police report and make sure that you'll get into trouble""

&#x200B;

I took the text message to the police station and had a report written for extortion, uttering threats and possible defamation (although that message wasn't sufficient). They had asked me to keep away from this person, change my number and address. And to keep the message as possible evidence for whatever comes next if charges are pressed. The cops also called her to confirm the message which she did.

This person, A, then called one of my friends and told them that they had not intended to get the police involved, and that she wanted to have this settled without getting police involved.

Question is, what now? Am I at fault? Did I actually go too far with her? How far is too far for #MeToo and appropriation?

TL:DR: I got blackmailed for #MeToo. What next?",6,0,meToo,niecemoriston,1,2019-02-02 20:56:44

My mom and I would drive all around my hometown searching for him. We would sit in silence going to all the places we thought he hung out. Only once did we find him strung out on campus at one of his friends home. He laid there shaking face down by the stairs. He was an addict. Always has been. My mom sent him to countless rehabs growing up and nothing seemed to phase him. He would go missing and then appear out of nowhere. I remember one night we heard a loud ceaseless banging at the apartment door. It was him and I remember how angry he was. He was screaming at my mom and me for how awful we were. She refused to open the door and called the cops. She told my dad that lived across town to come get me that it wasn‚Äôt safe. He said he‚Äôd be there soon. As the night continued he never showed and after a talking to from the cops my mom let him stay. He ended up ripping his bedroom door off the hinges and scraping insults into the door with a knife. 
Finally he went missing for real but my mom couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. It drove her crazy. A month passed and he got arrested for assaulting a minor in the town over. That was the happiest day of my life I thought. My body was finally free of the bruises and torment. That‚Äôs when it hit me mentally. I still couldn‚Äôt talk and I sunk deeper into my own mind.

"Drunkenness, Agency, and Rape: my room mate",4,a43kxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a43kxv/drunkenness_agency_and_rape_my_room_mate/,8,1544213455.0,"I live with a good guy. We have our own privacy and a shared space in the living room. We frequently go for beers after work and chat about our day. He knows that I'm gay and loves it. I know that he's straight and respect it. We don't question the partners we bring home, and he's a bit younger than me so I laugh at his horny young male romantic theatrics. There's a new girl every night it seems!!

Anyway, a month ago he and I got really drunk together, and a neighbor girl swung by to hang out. My room mate is a stud; looks like a 24 year old version of Tom Hardy with better hair. This girl was on the prowl for him! She was sober but tried to ""catch up with us,"" as we were pretty far in. I knew what she wanted, I knew what she was after. Anyways, we got more drunk and she tried to drag us to the club. I went to bed and they left.

Three hours later I woke up to the sound of them having sex and thought nothing of it. They both sounded pretty drunk.

But the next morning my room mate said to me,"" fuck man that was freaky. I woke up having sex with her. This weird girl is in my bed and I'm having sex with her!"" We spoke a bit more and then dropped it.

I know that she was preying on him hard, and got what she wanted, but I've got some serious questions here:

1. Was this rape?
2. She was drunk af when she landed in bed with him, so did she have the sense of responsibility and agency necessary to commit the act of rape, the mens rea if you will?

I want to ponder this more, because it seems that the #metoo dialogue is incredibly inconsistent on this point.

We tell ourselves often and loudly that if a person is drunk and we are sober, DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH THEM. They can't consent.

But then we also say,"" men need to take responsibility for their shitty behaviour and stop using their drunkenness as an excuse.""

Why? Why are men responsible for what they do when they are drunk? Responsibility implies agency and freedom. Why do men maintain their agency while drunk with respect to sexual initiation, but women do not? Or are women far more responsible than we are currently letting on? Perhaps women are responsible for their sexual behavior when they are drunk? Perhaps they are consenting? 

I don't like double standards. They bother me.

Presumably there is a level of drunkenness in which a person's ability to freely act is toast. We all know this.

But this new idea of ""if you are drunk, you can't consent to sex"" is problematical. If that holds as a rule, then people also cannot truly be guilty of rape if they are raping while drunk. They don't have agency anymore. It's not their fault.

At any rate, both my room mate and this girl were drunk. So were they both raped? Neither of them consented to the sexual activity they were engaging in.

I dont have an interesting title... I just have my story.,5,9qw151,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9qw151/i_dont_have_an_interesting_title_i_just_have_my/,1,1540350559.0,"When I was a freshman in highschool I had a crush on a boy who I bad been friends with for years. Lets call him ""Joey"". We were starting to really hit it off and we were hanging out a ton.
One night, ""Joey"" wanted me to skip a choir concert (something that I would never do lightly) so that we could hang out at his house. I was head over heels for him so I weighted my pros and cons and decided to skip my concert.
We hung out and talked for hours and it was wonderful, eventually we started fooling around. We both grew up pretty religiously, but were kinda rebelious, however, ""fooling around"", at this point in my life, meant basically just hand stuff.
We were having a good time but then he asked me to give him a blow job, something I had never done before. I wasnt offended by this but I told him that I just wasn't ready for that.
My response was followed by a good half hour of him begging me to change my mind, at this point I lost interest in fooling around for the night and asked if we could just go back to talking. He got so angry, started yelling at me, and then kicked me out of his house.
Keep in mind that I was supposed to be at a choir concert, so I couldnt exactly just go home (even though we lived near each other), so I spent the next few hours walking around in the rain until it was a reasonable time for me to have returned from the concert.

Fast forward..

It's my sophomore year of highschool. I had a flirtatious, mostly texting/sexting relationship with a boy that we will call ""Tommy"". One day he came and picked me up from church while my parents were in a different class and we fooled around in my back yard. It was this day that I gave my first ever blow job, to ""Tommy"". But it didnt go much further than that. We did our thing, he took me back to church, and life went on. We didnt ever really hook up again, but there was no drama, we just kinda fizzled.

Fast forward again...

Due to completely unrelated circumstances I ended up transferring to a different highschool within the same school district for my junior and senior years. I had needed a fresh start so with the transfer I also got a new phone number, cleansed my facebook, and cut ties with 90% of the people from my old high school including both of these boys. (not that I was close to either of them at that point anyway). Apparently ""Joey"" and ""Tommy"" became really close the summer between my junior and senior year and had come to the realization they had ""hooked up"" with the same girl, and decided to compare their experiences. 
Now how do I know about this? Because while I was sitting in my school cafeteria for lunch I got a string of messages from ""Joey"" demanding that I explain to him why I gave ""Tommy"" a blow job but not him. I was hurt and confused but decided not to respond because I didnt feel like I owed him an explanation. About 10 minutes later I got a string of new messages from ""Tommy"" telling me that ""Joey"" deserved a blow job, and that I should go back over to his house and finish what I started. And a bunch of other ridiculous things. These messages then kept coming for hours, getting more intense and even had a tone that felt threatening at times... until the end of the school day, when I guess they got bored because I wasnt responding.

Fast forward again...

I am 23 years old, and nothing ever ""happened"" from these texts. However, it's something that will pop into my head, probably more often then it should, and it makes me feel small. It makes me want to hide under covers. And the other day it popped into my head when I was reading some #MeToo posts on twitter and I felt like sharing my story, but I didnt want to share the story on FB or Twitter where people knew me and my story too well and might try and guess who they were, so I posted a very small edited version of this story on Whisper (I didnt have Reddit until today).

I said ""When I was a freshman I skipped a choir concert to hand out with the boy that I liked. We fooled around a little, but when I didnt want to give him a BJ, he kicked me out."" 
Here are some of the responses I got:
- ""Then say something before you get to his house""
- ""And?""
- ""Not Surprising""
- ""Give them now?""
- ""Wanna recreate a memory?"" 
- ""I would have too""
- ""Serves you right"" 

And it was not until THAT POINT (who knows why the hell THAT was my enlightenment) when it finally it hit me, and I realized that this experience wasnt just a ""boys will be boys"" type of thing. That this was scary behavior. And it wasnt just me being sensitive. 

I called up a good friend of mine who happened to be one of ""Joey""'s foster sisters in Jr High and when I told her she wasn't surprised, and she told me how he had molested her little brother, and they found out years later, and that's why he had stopped living with them. 

And then I looked ""Tommy"" up online and he had an aggravated assault arrest a couple years ago.  

And it actually makes me sick to think of how intimate I had let myself be with these boys, and that maybe if I had said something it would have been better. Maybe he would have been removed my friends home sooner, and her brother wouldnt have had to lived with the boy who molested him for as long as he did. Maybe the person who was assaulted would never have had to experience that... but... honestly, it's not like I kept it a secret. I didnt tell the cops, but I did tell my story. It was always met with laughs, and ""dumb highschool boys"" types of comments and I guess the point of this whole thing is...


STOP.
Stop belittling people's experiences. 
Stop excusing shitty behavior because of youth. 
Stop expecting people to just ""deal"" with feeling unsafe. 

Just stop.

My story of sexual abuse in it‚Äôs entirety.,6,9q5irf,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9q5irf/my_story_of_sexual_abuse_in_its_entirety/,3,1540144131.0,"I was five years old when the sexual abuse by my father began. It‚Äôs odd the things you remember at that age. I can almost remember the way the room was set up at the time. I remember the pink sundress I was wearing at one time. I remember it breaking some of my crayons and crumpling my picture. And I remember his weight on my back, but little else from when I was so small.   

I remember at 12 being raped in the bathroom by him. How he came in after I was undressed and bent me over the tub. I remember him leaving and then taking my bath as usual.   

I remember at 14 being in the dark, the room had been rearranged by then and I remember the light from the moon barely coming in through the window as I was on my stomach as he raped me. It‚Äôs the little things you remember, not the big details. I remember the positions I was in, how it felt vaguely, but I can describe the rooms in detail and remember what the alcohol smelled like.   

The first 16 years of my life my father‚Äôs touch was what I knew. Apart from the sexual abuse my father‚Äôs side of the family were all emotionally and physically abusive and I never knew what would or wouldn‚Äôt get me in trouble but with my cousins I defended myself. They would try to starve me out but I didn‚Äôt let them. I stabbed one cousin in the hand with a fork when they tried to take my food.   

When I turned 17 I met my first boyfriend at church camp. He was far from good though. He was emotionally manipulative and having already not learned the proper way to say no he pressured me into a lot of sex I didn‚Äôt want. I wouldn‚Äôt call it rape but it was unwanted sex. I was mentally ill from a young age but never knew what it was and he exploited it. He used it to his advantage to manipulate me into being who he wanted me to be.   

I eventually broke up with him because he was putting a wall between me and the only people who had ever loved me, my mother and my mother‚Äôs side of the family. He cussed my mother and that was the last straw. That break up was very ugly and it hurt very deeply. We had dated for 3 years. I didn‚Äôt date again until I was 21 and that one is a nightmare.   

It was my final year of college and I had finally gotten over that really ugly break up. I was finally looking to start dating again and I met this guy through a mutual friend that I met the beginning of that year. We talked and found out we were into a few of the same things, mostly movies and collecting trading cards.   

He insisted that he was a nice guy who was going through some pretty hard times. He was about to be a new father and was really scared. I tried to be there as a friend and help him out but he got really into me really fast.   

He would text me daily, sit beside me every time we had free time together and walk me to my classes and at the time I thought it was kind of cool. I liked the attention and the validation that I was attractive after the last breakup had really shaken my confidence. We had talked about that break up and he said he would never treat me like my ex had and I believed him. I had no reason not too. He was a nice guy.   

He asked me out with a poem including my name in it and I had to give him credit for creativity. No one had ever asked me out that way. I said yes but that I wanted to take things SLOW because I was still unsure of how ready I was for something serious. He said he would take it slow but that is not! What happened!   

We went on a couple normal dates, to the movies a couple times but he wasn‚Äôt fond of it when I would spend time with family or friends without him. Then he lost his job at Bi-Lo... with the new baby and this blow he got even worse. 

By Valentine‚Äôs Day we had been dating about two and a half months and I was still insisting we take things really slow because of past abuse and my lack of trust in people, especially men in general. But he insisted on taking me to my favorite restaurant even though he really didn‚Äôt have the money. The nearest one is 45 minutes away, a town over from where I live.   Since it was Valentine‚Äôs Day I agreed. I got in his Mercury and we drove the 45 minutes to the next town over. I have ptsd from my alcoholic father‚Äôs reckless driving so I was nervous to begin with. This guy thought he was a real hot shot and was a perfect driver. I kid you not, he went almost 80mph down the interstate weaving in and out of traffic.   

We make it to the restaurant alive and in one piece and get a table. He insists on sitting beside me. It made me rather uncomfortable because he was so much taller than me but I let it slide. It didn‚Äôt take long for our order to come to the table for which I was so glad. I was genuinely trying to enjoy the day. We ate slowly and he kept trying to convince me to come back to his house because he had a special surprise for me. I was very nervous about that and to ease my nervous suspicions he told me that he had a stuffed animal there for me and that he had written me a song (he played guitar, he could not sing, he thought he could.)   

Finally after a lot of pressuring and reassuring I agreed. I had never been to his house before and he lived a long way away from my house. At least another 45 minutes or so in the opposite direction. It took forever!! To get there and when we did he introduced me to his very sweet mother, his father, his grandparents, and his great grandmother. His family seemed genuinely like good nice people so I relaxed a bit.   

The stuffed animal was an adorable little evee plushy which I fawned over because that is my all time favorite Pok√©mon, and then he pulled out a three page lyric sheet. He picked up his guitar as we both sat on his bed. Then he started to play and sing. I wish I still had the lyric sheets to tell you what all it said but he talked about my ‚Äúsunflower eyes‚Äù (I have green/hazel eyes that have a golden ring around the iris. I‚Äôve gotten compliments my entire life about my eyes but I‚Äôve never had them described so creepily vividly.) and about the hole inside him and how he needed me to fill it. He said how he was scared I would see the real him and run... and in hindsight, I should have. I should have ran so fast, so far away... but I didn‚Äôt.   

After the song was done he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and started softly gushing into my ear about how beautiful I was and how good of a match for him and how much of his type I was. He started trying to ‚Äúrub my arm‚Äù but I kept feeling his fingers brush against the side of my breast. It was uncomfortable, I was uncomfortable, and I told him that. He acted like I hurt his feelings, like I didn‚Äôt trust him. Like after all this nice stuff he‚Äôd done to show how much he cared I was being really cold and insensitive.   

I was never really taught healthy boundaries or how to say no and it be taken seriously. I know now that I was susceptible to emotional manipulation, but back then, I fell right into the trap. I wish now I hadn‚Äôt but... I let him touch me. Just through my top at first but he took it further and further. Before I even realized how far, his hands were in my shirt. He wanted to take it even further but I told him I wasn‚Äôt ready and that I was trying to save sex for marriage and that I was Asexual.   

I have a low sex drive and I have to have a strong emotional bond with someone before I can ever find them sexually attractive. I can‚Äôt just look at someone and be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd tap that.‚Äù I had never found anyone sexually attractive yet though so I said I was Asexual. Though now I know I‚Äôm Demisexual.   

It finally got late and he laid off and took me home because if he hadn‚Äôt gotten me home in time my family would have flipped. My family asked me how it went and I said it went well. He was already in my head... I just didn‚Äôt realize it yet. The relationship itself only lasted two years but it felt like an eternity.  He got really clingy I had to text him whenever I wasn‚Äôt in class and had to tell him where I was often. He would get upset when I would go more than half an hour without texting him back. It eventually got to where I couldn‚Äôt go more than 10 minutes without him freaking out.   

After 3 months of this was the first time I tried to break up with him. He took me away from everyone and totally isolated me into a dark corner of the school cafe where no one could see us. He backed me against the wall and towered over me at over 6ft tall. I‚Äôm only 5ft so it was terrifying. I tried to stand my ground but being alone and easily broken down from past abuse I caved.   

We continued to date and at the end of that year I left college to pursue a career in Realestate. He said he supported me and until he got a new job he was kind of excited I was working even if it was only commission based. Though he still demanded that I text him almost constantly.   He got a job a couple months after that working as a delivery driver for Papa Johns and things got worse again! He would call me every time he was in the car and demanded that I answer. I usually answered because if I didn‚Äôt he would text and drive ranting at me. I didn‚Äôt want him putting himself or others in danger. I, no joke, was on the phone with him when he hit a man on his bike because he was too distracted talking to me. I felt awful for the poor man!  

I tried again to break up with him while visiting one day on the college campus because all of my friends where their but again... he broke me down and talked me out of it. My best friend who‚Äôs practically my sister was livid. She blew him out and he promised us both he would change, that he was a nice guy, that he would do better... he didn‚Äôt do better.   

We had talked about engagement on more than one occasion. I tried to be firm and make it clear that I wanted to wait at least three years to get engaged because my last relationship had gone so poorly. I told him I want to make sure that I knew the person I was getting engaged to 100%.   

But like with everything else he pressured and rushed me, and this is on the list of the worst things he did. We looked at rings which didn‚Äôt seem that strange to me. And I saw one that was absolutely gorgeous that I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford right away. He said he would save up the next two years and get it and that made me happy and put me at ease knowing he was going to respect my wishes.   Well, when he brought my mother and grandmother in he pulled up a video he had made of a Christian song that talks about the bride of Christ and had pictures of us and the words across the screen. My mother thought it was cute but my grandmother could tell something was off, she didn‚Äôt say anything though. Then he pulled out the ring, got on his knee, and of course asked me.   

I dissociated and said yes... he even dragged me by the hand he had just put the ring on into my grandad‚Äôs bedroom and asked for his blessing, after having proposed thinking that would earn him a yes. It did not. My grandfather held back from beating the guy but he definitely did not bless us.   

My mother was the only one supportive of the engagement. After that he went home... and I went to my room to try and figure out what had just happened. After that things seemed to go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù except now he was even more devoted to keeping me under his thumb forever because he took the commitment very seriously.   

He started belittling my work and taking me away from it because as a realtor I didn‚Äôt have set work hours and he would exhaust me with texts and calls demanding I spend his days off with him. Then, he lost the delivery job. He said he quit because he was miserable. I‚Äôm not so convinced that‚Äôs true.   

Either way, with more time he became increasingly aggressively clingy. He demanded I spend several days a week with him taking me away from work more and more often. He would become livid when I would spend time with friends and family and would throw massive angry guilt trips over text and if I didn‚Äôt answer he would call me. He literally would blow my phone up so much that it would eat the battery and would make my phone die. He wanted to be a part of everything I did. He wanted to be a part of everything I was. He wanted to be a part of who I was.   

Slowly I lost myself. He broke me down with his needs and his desires and his demands and then... I cracked... all of the stress and pressure triggered memories I had repressed of childhood sexual abuse. The abuse I talked about in the beginning of this. It started as nightmares and was making me really crazy. In hindsight I probably should have went to the hospital because of the severity of the psychological break but I tried therapy first. She diagnosed me with dissociative identity disorder and all those ‚Äúimaginary friends‚Äù and ‚Äústories‚Äù I had ‚Äúcome up with‚Äù over the years we‚Äôre actually my split personalities. It was a relief to understand it all finally. All my struggles through my whole life were because of my dissociative identity disorder.   

Several times he drove me to those therapy appointments almost 45 minutes away and would ask me on the way back (all the way back) what I had discussed with the therapist and most of the time I would lie. I didn‚Äôt want him knowing that. It was deeply personal. To get him to stop riding me about what I was remembering I told him one of the nightmares. I would later come to deeply regret that.   

My sex drive totally withered during this time and had never really been high to begin with. He grew more forceful and demanding about that too. He felt he deserved it because he was a good boyfriend and a nice guy. Often times I was so exhausted and so in need of some kind of comfort that I would give in just so he would hold me after even after telling him no repeatedly before that. My no meant nothing to him because he always was able to wear me down.   

I remember one distinct time he insisted on taking me to his house after therapy. He tried to have sex with me and I became physically ill as he touched me. He only stopped when I went pale and I rushed to the bathroom. He did take me home after that. It was kind of like the gif of the woman reaching to touch the dog and the dog being so ‚ÄúNOPE‚Äù that he nearly vomits on her. Once I was home and away from him I started to feel better but pretended to have the flu just so I could get a week away without his body all over me.   

One night after months of being treated horribly like this I finally put my foot down fully. I told him that I did not want any more sex that day, we had already done ‚Äúthe deed‚Äù multiple times, and that I wanted him to take me home right then. That‚Äôs the moment that I regretted telling him about my nightmare.   

He enacted it move for move. I dissociated. I left my body and became 5 years old all over again. I didn‚Äôt cry or fight. I just let it happen. He used a condom and left no marks so there was nothing physical and since it was at his house in his room I had and still have no one to confirm any of this. It is completely his word against mine.   It took me two weeks to recover fully as I went through those days after in a fog. Finally he said he wanted to come get me from work and ‚Äúspend the day with me or just get a hug.‚Äù and I told him to come. I worked with my grandparents who are also Realestate agents and my cousin, who at the time was a 16 year old girl was in town. She‚Äôs like my favorite person. I confronted him behind my office and told him I was done. 

He begged for a fourth chance but this time, not being alone, and being so fucking done, I stood my ground. I gave him the ring he had given me back and left him standing in the parking lot.   He tried to follow me in but my amazing cousin blocked the door and my grandfather ran him off. That‚Äôs the last time I saw him in person. It took 12 days after that, the threat of a restraining order, and involving his mother to get him to stop contacting me. He even sent me a video of him sobbing in his car about how horrible he was feeling and how badly he wanted me back.    

During all the madness in that relationship. I reconnected with a friend from my second year of college. He quickly became my best guy friend. He was supportive and kind during it all. And he was there for me when my father died and my dad‚Äôs side of the family turned on me blaming me for supposedly abandoning him and hurting him. When I stopped going because of the pain he was causing me by choosing his damn drink over taking care of his own daughter.   

We started dating on the sixth of July two years ago and I‚Äôve found happiness and stability since. I‚Äôm in a good place but this is the first time that I‚Äôve ever shared my story in its entirety.",6,0,meToo,Lady-Witch,0,2018-10-21 20:48:51

Asia Argento‚Äôs own abuse?,6,9bdnd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9bdnd3/asia_argentos_own_abuse/,6,1535579442.0,"I could be wrong but all this time I‚Äôve been reading about her abuse towards Jimmy, I still haven‚Äôt seen anyone talking about the bizarre relationship she has with her father, Dario Argento.  He was putting her in his movies at a pretty young age in very sexualized roles, was he not?  And having her be raped in at least one?

When I heard about her having some kind of weird sexually mothering relationship with this kid I wasn‚Äôt really surprised.  Here‚Äôs a couple interesting things from the Nicki Swift site (who I don‚Äôt trust as the most credible source because she seems like a gossip columnist but she‚Äôs citing other sources):

Speaking with Filmmaker Magazine, Argento said, ""I never acted out of ambition; I acted to gain my father's attention. It took a long time for him to notice me. ‚Ä¶ And he only became my father when he was my director."" Even after that, it was a strange relationship, as her characters in his films were, according to The Guardian, ""undressed, raped and generally psychologically traumatised on screen.""

Argento told Rolling Stone that she never discussed the scandalous roles with her father in anything other than professional terms. ""We don't speak about these things. We speak almost only about cinema, especially about silent movies, with which we have this mutual obsession."" In the same interview, she described her disdain for childhood, in general, calling it ""disgusting,"" and claiming, ""But I always had this feeling of never being a part of anything, not even of my family. My parents forgot about me. I did everything I could to get their attention.""

Like any music aficionado worth their weight in concert ticket stubs, Argento is a passionate collector of vinyl. She said she keeps three turntables at home and maintains a relationship with the son of a local record shop owner who makes house calls with ""needles and other stuff"" that she needs to upkeep her collection. She even puts her stacks of wax to use by dropping the needle during a weekly ""kids day"" at her house, during which she DJs for ""12 kids at a time."" In her words: ""It's a pretty good way to manipulate young egg-shell minds.""",6,0,meToo,VesuvianVillain,1,2018-08-30 00:50:42

Friends get drunk. 
Girl suggests guy come back to place with her and boyfriend so he doesn‚Äôt drink and drive. 

Boyfriend goes to bed. Girl gets sick in bathroom. Friend comes to hold hair back. Girls goes to bed. Guy pressures drunk girl into kissing. Girl finally gets drunk guy to leave her alone. She passes out. Assuming drunk guy is a good guy and made a drunken mistake. 

Boyfriend wakes up to girlfriend still sleeping,and drunk guy touching her and pulling down her pants. 

Boyfriend freaks out. Wakes girlfriend up, tell her that she‚Äôs a cheating whore. 

Drunk girl is still drunk, and is having a hard time waking up, and catching up. Realizes pants are at knees, and someone is touching her. Flips out. 

Drunk friend grabs his pants which were on the floor. Runs into different room to get dressed. 

Boyfriend still freaking out on girlfriend who is still trying to process all of the information. 

Drunk guy runs out of house. Boyfriend still yelling at girlfriend for being a slut. Drunk girl gets emotional. 

Fast forward. 

Boyfriend tells his family. Boyfriends mother tells girlfriend that she got what she ‚Äúdeserved. ‚Äú

Male friends, ‚Äúwhy did you let him stay the night if you didn‚Äôt want to do something‚Äù

Females, ‚Äúyou were cheating on your boyfriend. ‚Äú

Fucking truth: girl was drunk. Was trying to be nice. Society showed how fucked up they are.  Girl forever changed. Girl no longer wants to be kind. Girl no longer wants a lot of things out of life. Girl no longer feels true happiness. 

Years, and years later, the girl is still full of anger, and resentment. Girl still doesn‚Äôt understand how she was a slut. Girl still doesn‚Äôt understand why trying to do something nice would turn out so ugly. Girl no longer feels love towards many people. Girl goes through motions with the people she‚Äôs stuck with. Girl just doesn‚Äôt see the world the same anymore. Girl no longer feels safe. Girl feels like she has to be a protector, while struggling, knowing she didn‚Äôt protect herself when she needed it most. Girl has given up. The pain is so deep. The wounds still bleed years later.

I am also the spouse of a woman who is the victim of sexual assault, but this has been bothering because of the many recent sexual assault and harassment allegations. I am currently working on my MBA and am hoping to one day be in the upper echelon of a company and/or managing a team of people or department. However, I feel nervous that someone could come forward to Human Resources or to the media that they were sexually harassed by me if they feel slighted by lack of a promotion, pay increase, or if they just don't like me, whether the person is a man, woman, or identifies outside of cisgender bounds. My distress here is that in the court of public opinion I feel that evidence is not required and can be considered hearsay, and that it can be used to intentionally defame a person's reputation. I feel that accusations must be disproven by the accused instead of evidence being provided by the victim. I feel also that if the accused were to file charges of slander or libel then they're reputation would be further damaged because it would be considered as further psychological damage to the victim.

I‚Äôm honestly still a little surprised about this ‚Äúawakening‚Äù that has happened. While I am thankful for the #metoo movement and the changes it has wrought, I am still perplexed as to how so many never seemed to have seen it before. I have lived in a body that has been eyed, touched, groped, spanked, molested, and degraded so many times as to have become mundane. Sexual harassment so much a fabric of the reality in which I have walked, that it is hard to imagine how invisible it was to so many. It‚Äôs even harder to imagine that somehow a single event has been able to impress the gravity of this truth onto those who had not seen it before. I still somehow feel that understanding of what it means to walk through this world as a woman escapes even those who have ‚Äúwoken up.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know if it is shock or cynicism that mixes despair into what should be a joyous elixir, but it all feels so fleeting and hollow. I am scared to get too excited, scared to hope for a better future, scared to trust that there is suddenly safety in this world. I have danced along a knife‚Äôs edge in every publicly waking moment since I have been a teenager, and I am terrified that there may suddenly no longer be a tightrope upon which to walk. I am reticent to believe I may ever feel safe in the event that I cast away armor that is one day needed.

( english is my second Language so excuse my bad grammar ,  it might also get confusing at some points so I apologize ahead for that)  

This happened about 10 to 7 months ago
And it happed a lot over these 3 months 
Almost on a daily basis...  
And I haven't told anyone about what happened 
And I'm not sure if I should report this or not... 

When I was still whit my ex boyfriend 
 
He used to take advantage of me 
A lot...  
And I don't want him to get into trouble... 
But I also know that I shouldn't juts sweep this under the rug to...  

I originally promised him that I would never tell anyone but ,  I can't just forget about it...  No matter how hard I try 

All of this first started in march of last year 
The first time it happend it wasn't that bad 
He juts touch my chest... Which didn't bother me to Mutch but I asked him to not do it again...  
He did it anyways
And i did my best to ignore it 

But over time he started getting more forceful...  
And in June he started going under the waist line...  
I told him many times that I didn't want it 
And that it hurt...  
He just started becoming rougher when I told him... 
After the 2th month of this...  
I just stoped saying anything 
And I just let it happen 
I started ignoring the pain 
And I just started looking at him
I saw his eyes looking me straight in the face...  
Like he lots all control 
I saw that that wasn't him...  
Or that's what I want to believe.... 
His face just...  
Was so blank... 
And his eyes looked dark...  

I feel like somehow this is my fault for letting this happen...  
I didn't scream because I was afraid if my mother found out she would call the police on him... 

And like I said earlyer...   I don't want him to get into any trouble

But I'm not sure if I'm making the right decision by not telling anyone
And I'm afraid if I do tell Someone they won't believe me...  
Because he told everyone I'm crazy and I'm just trying to ruin his life !  
Which isn't true I want the best for him! 

I want him to have a good life, i don't want the rest of his life to be ruined because of this...  
I don't want his dream college to denie him 
I don't want him to go to prison...  
Or get a criminal record ! 

I just wana forget about it...  
And so dose he probably...  

Is there anything I can do other then try to pretend like it didn't happen?

I studied my Bachelor in one of countries where speaks Chinese. But the program was entirely i  English, so somehow i became so called Native teacher here in Korea. Anyway, that was for my living. Until this Feb, i was pursuing acting in films. I knew it is not easy to get recognized, so i was doing it only partly(i mean acting). 
About January, a quite legit film contacted me for the audition. To be frank, the audition itself was a positive experience. However, this was an indie film about sexism and labor right. 
One day, i was invited to director's dearest friend, a male actor, who was around 50 roughly. I was not in that movie; but they invited me as a friend. 
The thing is, the director asked me to prepare some stuffs so everyone can stay up all night and talk. So i told him, you have all that responsibility to protect me if anything ever happens. Guess what? Somehow me and that 50 years old actor remained until around the morning after that day. Nothing happened besides he tried to kiss me above my body. 
So that hurt my boundary issue. I told the director and one of senior female actor(well korea has that damn senior system). First they seemed listening to me. 
Later they told me, I'm overreacting and they feel uncomfortable about my comments on that actor. They have told me that, i don't have to report them as I'm adult and independent. Figure it out by yourself. Also the director said that i have a huge misunderstanding on that actor. 
I don't think that action(trying to kiss) was something pleasant, of course is wrong. But what did more upset me is 3rd people's reaction. 
The thing is they're known as so-called seniors in that film industry. So what? Did they know what is wrong and whom they need to support? Yet, why the hell you're making a movie about criticizing sexism on korean society? 
I didn't publish it before, cause i didn't want to remind of all those moments. But i realized that it is better to speak out. It makes us to encourage each other.
I don't know. Sometimes I'm annoyed and angry cause of my co-workers and boss, but about my metoo, i feel disgusted. Don't know what to say more. ",4,0,meToo,grabyourfork,1,2019-03-18 08:19:41
I am still in love with my abuser/sexual harasser and am moving closer to him [StockholmSyndrome],4,ayy71h,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/ayy71h/i_am_still_in_love_with_my_abusersexual_harasser/,1,1552095718.0," 

I am still in love with my abuser/sexual harasser and am moving closer to him \[StockholmSyndrome\]

I am nervous and excited because I may be moving close to the school where the principal sexually harassed me. I need to move out before my parents come home (who were my worst abusers of all) and there are not many apartment options I can choose from.

He was inappropriate and abused his power as the principal of the school while I was an intern and I was not the only woman he harassed. He was married and recently had a kid. He would pretend he was not married around me, though, as he would take his ring of whenever I interned. He think he thought I was dumb and was amused when I did airhead things like bump into walls, get overly excited and act confused/fearful in his presence. I think I fed his ego whenever i got submissive around and needed his help because I seemed so incapable. When in reality a lot of me seeming incapable also had to do with him making me feel so dysregulated because my PTSD symptoms would act up around him. He wouldn‚Äôt take no for answer and did not respect boundaries. He was impulsive, quick to anger, and one time belittled me and told me he couldn't see me in the profession I was going to school for. He often treated me like I was amusing because I was incapable and he didn‚Äôt really respect me but you could tell he thought i was cute and preferred me silly, submissive, and dumb. When I wasn‚Äôt my silly self and was serious, assertive and intelligent, he seemed shocked and less attracted to me. 

One time he touched my leg while saying good morning and another time he touched my waist to lean in to hear what I was saying. He became very jealous when I talked to other male coworkers and one time he told off a coworker and eyed me down like he owned me. He tried to intimidate me and didn‚Äôt like when I challenged his authority. I felt like he treated me like property even though I was in no way his and he was married! But he also protected me at times from my rude supervisor and when I was down, I could tell he would be sad and cared about me. But I also feel like he would get down when I was down because it meant I wouldn‚Äôt give him attention. When I rejected him, he didn‚Äôt take it well and it made him very emotionally dysregulated---extreme sadness, anger, etc. I realize now I was probably triggering his attachment issues as he definitely had anxious/ambivalent attachment and I have disorganized so I can be very avoidant. I don‚Äôt even think he really knew much about me so I wonder how much he truly liked about me or was it more he was trying to repair an attachment wound that mirrored what happened when he was a child. Then he started harassing another female coworker after I rejected him and she tried resisting his advances. But then she started liking him because he is so charming and then i got jealous and asked her if she was okay. She knew that I knew and immediately ended the affair with the principal.

My Disorganized attachment was happening where I avoided him once I noticed that he really liked me and was no longer unavailable. Intimacy is scary and I knew the risk of him abandoning me was high as he had a family.. But also i think my ptsd hypervigilance was kicking in to protect me because he was not a safe person and was unstable (could have had borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder). I avoided him because he was married also scary because of his angry and commanding energy (but I also was so drawn to that energy). Ultimately, I rejected him because I knew I would crumble if he ended up hurting me. I was totally traumatically bonded to the principal. Yes, I was attracted to him and admired him for his leadership and work ethic. Also, being around him made me feel so feminine because we were pretty different/polarizing. He was also confident and stereotypically masculine. Plus I admired him so much--so hard working, dominant, and powerful. Plus I liked his sense of humor. While I was often scared of him, I also think i fell in love with him during my internship and I haven‚Äôt like someone that much since (2 years ago) . I feel like he saw the worst flawed parts of me and still liked me and kept fighting to be with me. Omg, I do not think I am over him.

On the last day of my internship, he kept trying to be around me and stare at me. At one point, my supervisor was rudely asked him what he was staring at. He asked me to help him with something and then he told me I was always welcome at his school. Then my supervisor came in because she could tell he was trying to talk to me.. And then he walked away because he had to go pick up his daughter. I told him thank you. That was the last time I talked to him. I loved him.

I didn‚Äôt report him because I was confused because I also liked him and He also was so charismatic, I knew he could easily get anyone to believe him and made me see like the crazy one. Especially because most of the people thought I was weird and crazy because of my extreme mood swings and ptsd symptoms. 

So anyways, yesterday, I ran into a girl who I remember used to be at his school when I was touring the apartment. She told me she would tell my old supervisor she saw me. The supervisor‚Äôs office is right by the principals plus they are close‚Ä¶ so then i was like omg she may tell the supervisor and then the principal would find out (I would have really worried about that 2 years ago when he was exhibiting stalkerish behaviors). Another part of me was like, I hope she tells him so he knows‚Ä¶ then another part of me was like, omg he probably doesn‚Äôt even think about me anymore.. I‚Äôm the one who needs to move on.

So, do I move to that apartment close to his school or not? And anyone else have been in this situation before where you fall for an unavailable man and you fear and love him at the same time? Tips on how you got over him?",4,0,meToo,journey1992,1,2019-03-09 04:41:58

Side note: to around 10 y.o. my hair was knee long, blond, so it looked beautiful. And this old man liked it. He kissed my hand and said I looked beautiful etc etc. I really don't remember much, but I think it really weird, for someone this old be interested in little girl, even kiss her hand...I don't know, it creeps me.

I think I was 13-14 y.o. when I was in the subway, (If I remember correctly I was with my friends from art school, they were in the seats and I stood), it was busy time, so people stood very close to each other. It was summer and I was in the skirt. Mini skirt. At the time I still was comfortable wearing more open clothes, and my parents never said to me that I looked too mature in the wrong way for my age (which I was... To much in my opinion), and my mom even encouraged it... Anyway, I stood in the train, not really able to move too much, when I felt something like plastic bag get under my skirt from the back and started lifted it (if you wear/wore this types of skirts, you know how easy they lifted, even from simple movement). I, even though I knew some about sex at this point, didn't know about groping in public. I simply though that someone's bag got under my skirt accidentally, so I just put skirt down. But it proceeded in that way. I turned around, trying to hold skirt in place, and looked at bag owner to indicate that I don't like it. Being shy, social awkward and socially phobic, I didn't say anything at all. Person who stood behind me was a man at his late 30s I think. I don't remember what was with his bag after, but I remember at some point I realised that what was under my skirt, is a finger. And this finger slowly stroked my private part through my pants. I couldn't say anything. At some point he stopped. I, again, don't remember that much, but I remember finger, stroking me. I think this fucked me up a little.

Since then, nothing too close to this type of physical happened, but there still was things worth mention.

Again, subway train, year or so later, many people, I stood with my back against wall. Some man stood with his hands on both sides of my body. First, it was because there really was nowhere to stay (or so I thought), but at next station, many people went off, but men still stood. My friends looked funny at me and men, but stayed silent, as another passangers too. And me. I think I've been confused and frozen shoked. He almost pressed on me with his body weight. When it was finally our stop, I had to double over a little and go under his hand, still on the wall. I still don't know if what I felt pressed against me was his belt or boner...

Another story happened a few years later, and it was, thankfully ""just"" verbal harassment. New boy came to our class, he was originally from the countries where women consider way down on social pyramid then men. There many stereotypes about them in our country, which is rasist, but in most cases sadly true. They known for cat calling every pretty girl they see on the street, and almost stalking them. And it's actually scary, because they usually do it in groups. But I know quite a few guys who not meet this stereotype, but not a boy who harassed me. He many times tried to ""court"" me, said some things about me which made me uncomfortable. And I know I said it, but I hardly remember what it was, only that it made me want to hind or run. He did it in front of whole class, teachers, and no one ever said or did something about it.  I said him I'm not interested more than once, but he never stoped. I once even snapped at him and yelled things like ""go back to your country"" which I really regret and sorry for, no matter which reason I had. Really scary moment for me was when I once went in toilet, it was closer to the end of day, and this area was empty, except for this guy and his older brother. While I went by them, they looked at me with smug faces and talked about something at their native language. 

I skip things like guys inappropriately commenting on my boobs and other body parts, and to a more recent thing. I'm now 23, and 1,5 year ago I worked at a small firm. I came there in late October and in December we had New year party. So I still was uncomfortable with this people. Party was at a cafe/restourant/shitty place with hair in food/whatever, and there was a fucking ""dj"" . And so you know, I live in post Soviet country, so music listened by 40+ year olds is shit. No jokes. it just some kind of different mentality. And that ""dj"" played this music. And of course, unknown people, environment, shit music, social anxiety issues - I couldn't and didn't want to dance. I was not alone at this, thankfully, but others was male and one of them too old and deaf for this shit. So at one point of night, after fruitless attempts to ""why are you not dancing""s, one employee was so pissed, he decided if mohammed won't come to the mountain... He gonna bring mohammed (me) to the mountain (dancefloor). He took me ""bridal style"" from my seat and proseed to manhandle me. I screamed a little, bringing everyone's attention and pulled away, thankfully he put me in my feet. I was really terrified. And everyone looked at me like I spoiled them party. I went back to my seat, and drunk vine like I never had before. Funny, but I never get even slightly tipsy at this party, even thought I'm easily drunk from half of vine glass. After that I went to bathroom and tried to breathe and think how to get the fuck out of there. I remember later my coworker, youngest after me female, said me ""don't be offended with him, he's just drunk"". Later I was made to dance to slow song with him... It was longest 3 minutes of my life. Luckily, I had a chance, and I excused myself from a party with ""I ate too much and don't feel so well"" which was half true, because whole experience made me sick. I couldn't talk or be too close to that men later for long time. 
Sorry for my outburst, but it was most recent and terrible experience to me.

Regretting not reporting two years later,4,aq9vml,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aq9vml/regretting_not_reporting_two_years_later/,3,1550083395.0,"when I was 16 my best friend and some acquaintances and I went to the beach and we were drinking. I was 16 and overzealous with the alcohol. I only remember bits and pieces of that entire day. My last sober memory was sitting on the beach by an acquaintance and chain smoking cigarettes. After this its little clips in my brain of everything that happened the rest of the evening. I went and laid by the shore and ended up passing out there drifting in and out of consciousness. I could hear unfamiliar voices but for the most part they sounded friendly just strangers. I ended up moving and sitting with the new strangers and my friends in a kind of circle we all talked. It was a man and a woman and it appeared that they probably used hard drugs (I saw this appearance regularly so it was obvious they were using) I remember the man having very short/buzzed hair and a large beard. He was always staring at me. I couldn't hold my head up very well but everytime I did look up he was staring at me very intently and I saw him lick his lips. my best friend told her sister to watch me while she went to her car to get something because I was pretty inebriated and kind of needed babysat in case I drunkenly walked off or threw up, she was also uneasy about the strangers (I guess no one else was) Her sister and her sister's boyfriend who were with me and the strangers left me and went elsewhere, around this time the woman left too. I remember being taken to a car in the back seat (not his car) and waking up with the bearded man touching me and kissing me. I drifted back out of consciousness. Then I woke up again and my best friend opened the car door and told him to ""get the fuck out"" and had someone pick me up and carry me to her car. when I woke up the next day I had 17 missed calls, a voicemail, and a few texts. The voicemail went ""hey this is Jerry uh from the beach we hung out in your friends car call me back"" and the texts were trying to engage me in conversation. I told him I was 16 and I didn't know him and he was a grown man. This didn't stop him either. He proceeded to try to text me and I asked him how old he was to emphasize on the fact I was an underage girl. He was 37 which was the same age as my parents. I told him this and he still continued to text and call me repeatedly until I blocked his number. I asked my friend what she saw when she got there and she wouldn't tell me. she said it wasn't a big deal and she didn't think he did anything to me. she thought that the voicemails and the texts and calls were funny. She recorded the voicemail on  Snapchat and laughed. fast forward two years, as of a couple months ago her and I are no longer speaking. One of the last things she sent me was that Snapchat of the voicemail. She knew it made me uncomfortable. Around the time the event happened it was played off as not a big deal by her so I followed suit. I just told her not to talk about it. She's the only reason I didn't report him because I felt belittled for being upset about the situation ""nothing really happened"" I cried and I felt disgusting. I scrubbed myself until I hurt. I brushed my tongue til it bled. it's all fresh on my mind now that she resent the voicemail. I always hear people say that ""it's not your fault"" even if I was drunk, and I don't know whether I believe that, just because of how drunk I really was. I want him held accountable but it's too late and I was drunk so he'll get away with it. ",4,0,meToo,Pantyraider8000,1,2019-02-13 21:43:15

Can‚Äôt Help But Blame Myself,4,a702wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a702wv/cant_help_but_blame_myself/,2,1545055502.0,"This is my story, it‚Äôs also my attempt to come to terms with what happened to me. Everyone I speak to can easily identify the sexual assault part of the story and tells me that it isn‚Äôt my fault. But somehow, I find that I put most of the blame on myself. Retrospectively, I know that I‚Äôm wrong. But that little voice in my head, and deep down in my heart, tells me that it was my fault and to bear the responsibility.

I‚Äôm an 18 year old female. I go to college and live on campus. I actively frequent parties on my weekends, and I do drink and use weed in its different forms. I am also what society would label as ‚Äúpromiscuous‚Äù. I sleep with who I want, when I want, and am very open about it. Before I continue, I feel the need to defend myself: I am a smart, intelligent, and bright female. I was in the top 10% of my class in high school, I go to a great university, and am in the honors college. What I do in my free time, is my own business. But my grades, my behavior, my personality, and my actions, NONE of them, make what happened to me okay. They do not make me any less or more deserving of what happened. No one deserves anything that falls under abuse/assault.

This past Friday (12/14/18) was the date of my assault. I have trouble calling it ‚Äúassault‚Äù because of the circumstances that surround it. It‚Äôs not a cut and dry case of rape or sexual abuse. I was not forced, I was not held down, and I never said no. But I know that it was assault.

My friends and I had decided we all wanted to go to a party on Friday. We had all been invited to an invite-only at a frat that we often go to. And by ‚Äúoften‚Äù, I mean every other weekend. There were also other frat parties going on that night. My friends had decided to go to a different party, but I was adamant about going to the one we usually go to and had decided I would go with a friend who was also a brother of said frat. Because I knew I would have less friends and would need to make some at the party, I decided to take the last bit of an edible I had laying around. My friend and I get to the party around 10:30pm, and the edible hits as soon as I step foot in the driveway of the house. Needless to say, I was very very high. I didn‚Äôt mind, I was planning on having a good time. We get inside and I immediately start drinking. I‚Äôm not a heavy drinker so I was pacing myself, simply due to the fact that I hate how alcohol tastes.

Ten minutes into being there, I get word from my friends that they‚Äôre actually going to be joining me and were already headed to the frat I was at. I was extremely happy because it meant that I wouldn‚Äôt be alone all night. When they arrived, we all had a great time together. We drank, we danced, and enjoyed ourselves. Around 2:15am we decide that it was definitely time to Uber back to campus. Two of my friends were extremely drunk, to the point of not being able to stand on their own. Before I left I spoke to a handsome junior, but didn‚Äôt get his name, number, or socials. We quickly left after that. That night I decided to sleep over at my friends‚Äô building because they all lived across campus together and it was safer than attempting to walk 15 minutes back to my dorm. At this point I was still drunk, and very very very high.

When we got back, my friend and I decided to go to the dining hall across from her building. We got there, ate, and were leaving around 3:10am. As we were walking out, we ran into the very handsome man I had spoken to earlier in the night. Let‚Äôs call him Isaac. Isaac and I spoke briefly, exchanged snapchats, flirted a bit, and parted ways. As soon as we got back to my friend‚Äôs building, he snapped me. I was obviously very happy because this was the attention I was hoping for from him. He told me he wanted to see me and to let him into the building I was in. I told him that it wasn‚Äôt my building and if he wanted anything to happen, there wouldn‚Äôt be a room available for us. He said that was fine but that he still wanted to see me. I went and got him, and he decided to walk me back to my friend‚Äôs room. Half way there, we‚Äôre in a stairway, we started making out and he also had his hands in my bra. This was completely fine with me, but I reiterated that there was no room available. He stopped and said it was fine, and said he would still walk me.

We got to the room‚Äôs door and he started making out with me again. This time was more aggressive. He once again stuck his hand in my bra and had his other hand on top of my pelvic region outside of my jeans. I told him I had to go, and he let me. Back in my friend‚Äôs room (her common room to be exact) was where I was going to sleep. I got a pillow and got comfy on the couch. Pretty soon after, Isaac started snapping me again. He told me he wanted to see me and started insisting. I told him that I would go to him but that I was much too high to walk. (This part of the night is fuzzy, so the details aren‚Äôt great) At some point he had sent a picture of his friend and mentioned that he thought I was cute. I passingly said he was cute back but didn‚Äôt really put any mind to it. He told me that I should come over, again. I kept insisting that I was too high to walk. He then offered to come get me so we could walk back together. I told my friends and they said that I shouldn‚Äôt go because it was late and the dorm was a good 8 minute walk away. I told them I was fine (I wasn‚Äôt) and I left (I shouldn‚Äôt have).

They picked me up at the front of the building and it was Isaac and his friend, we‚Äôll call him Edward. The walk there was full of small talk and we discussed where we were from. (I would later find out that a lot of what Isaac told me wasn‚Äôt true) I remember being very high at this point and struggling to keep up with them. We eventually arrived at what seemed to be Edward‚Äôs dorm. They led me to the common room where they told me I could sit on the couch.

At this point it was the three of us, we were all sitting down. Edward was on the same long couch as me, and Isaac was on the matching love seat style couch next to us. They were drinking Budweiser and offered me some, but I declined. They insisted for a bit but gave up when they saw that I wouldn‚Äôt budge. I remember feeling kind of uncomfortable but chalked it up to me being high. There was some small talk here and there, but for the most part it was silent. I eventually received a Snapchat text from Isaac (even though he was right across from me) and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the energy that you had‚Äù, meaning that I was not acting sexy and cool as I was before. Out loud, I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, aren‚Äôt I? You haven‚Äôt made any moves‚Äù, and this is where I remember I was officially uncomfortable. He looked at Edward and said something like ‚Äúshe‚Äôs calling you a pussy, make a move.‚Äù This made Edward grab my face and start making out with me. At the time, I was okay with it, because it seemed like it was something along the lines of a threesome/train. Which were things that I had never experienced, but was open to in a consensual way.

As soon as Edward and I had started making out, Isaac left. He wouldn‚Äôt come back for another 30 minutes. I remember giving Edward oral and receiving it, but not enjoying it. I vividly remember having my eyes closed the whole time, thinking that if I could get him off quickly, that it would be over. I remember imagining him as someone else. I remember almost throwing up while giving him head. I remember not wanting to be there, but not wanting to disappoint or get Isaac upset. Eventually Edward decided to get a condom so we could have sex. I remember sitting on the couch and feeling like my head was spinning. This was when Isaac came back. He came in, touched me down there, put his fingers in my mouth, and then left. This was the last I saw of him that night.

Edward and I would go on to try to have sex but it didn‚Äôt work because of his whiskey dick. I remember being so upset that he wouldn‚Äôt finish, I just wanted to leave. Eventually I gave him head and he came. During the process I remember him fingering me and being so dry that it hurt. I was high and couldn‚Äôt feel much though. We finished and he offered to walk me back. It was an uncomfortable walk and I remember feeling like something wasn‚Äôt right. I got back into my friend‚Äôs building and fell asleep on the floor with my shoes and jacket still on.

The next morning I would come to find out that Isaac had blocked me on Snapchat after screenshotting our conversation. It was at that moment that I realized that Isaac had used me. In my drunk and high state, he had set me up with his friend Edward, and had made me think that it was him and I who were going to hook up to get me to the dorm. But I never consented to Edward alone.

I can‚Äôt help but feel dirty, and blame my own promiscuity. I wasn‚Äôt raped, or forced, but I was misled and manipulated and taken advantage of. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever bring myself to put all the blame on Isaac. I‚Äôm pretty certain that Edward had been lied to as well, and didn‚Äôt realize that I had not consented to him. But I was high, I couldn‚Äôt make my own decisions, and I know that I did something that I didn‚Äôt want to. I have this feeling on me of dirtiness that I can‚Äôt wash off. I see Isaac‚Äôs face every time I close my eyes. When I attempt to sleep, I‚Äôm brought back to that common room, having my eyes closed, trying to imagine myself anywhere but there. I don‚Äôt know how I can come to terms with it and move on. But I have to.",4,0,meToo,throwawaygetreckt,1,2018-12-17 17:05:02

"My ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" Rant",5,a6b5ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/a6b5ov/my_baby_its_cold_outside_rant/,12,1544838516.0,"You know, the most oft-used defense of ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" is that we can't judge a 1944 song by 2018 values.  I call bullshit.

In 1944 African Americans were lynched regularly in the south. They couldn't go to the same schools. And they weren't called ""African American."" And I cringe when I hear the words that were used.  Doctors promoted the health benefits of cigarettes. Being gay meant denying yourself or denying acceptence. Being a woman meant being subservient to your husband or somehow immorally single and unable to get a man.

When Frank Loesser sold the song to MGM in 1949, his wife said, ""I felt as betrayed as if I'd caught him in bed with another woman.""

There are two scenes in Neptune's Daughter (1949) that feature the song. In one, Ricardo Monteban keeps pressuring Esther Williams to stay, taking off her coat right after she puts in on and putting his hands on her as she immediately removes them. The context here is that she thinks Montebon's character is hitting on her despite what she believes is his relationship with her sister.

In the second, Red Skelton makes silly faces as Betty Garret's character acts similarly to Montebon. One major difference here: the context is that Skelton's character is pretending to be Spanish speaking Jose to get a girl and Betty Garret is all over him despite his lies.

I always thought it was creepy. And the only honest defense of the song is it sounds pretty and you get nostalgic for it - and that's fine - but your personal nostalgia doesn't make it any less creepy. Esther Williams was an Olympic quality swimmer whose Wikipedia page is littered with mostly failed and depressing relationships only got better after LSD.

Anniversaries,6,9vqi8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9vqi8q/anniversaries/,2,1541814967.0,"5 years ago i was sexually assaulted 3 times in 4 months. Sunday marks the anniversary of the first. My PTSD has a funny way of laying low and then coming back full force around an anniversary. For the past few years around march 23rd i would go off my medicine, go on a bender, become almost comatose or try to kill myself. 

I'm doing ""better"" now, though. I'm working full time and taking classes again next semester. I can't let myself fall apart and go crazy. 

I don't even really have anyone to talk to about it anymore. when i was in college, i had so many supportive friends i could always talk to, cry with and hug. i work in an office and even though i've made friends, i can't talk to any of them about it. I can text my friends, but theres something about being able to say the words out loud and get them out there. 

I can count on one hand how many times I've talked about my miscarriage out loud. never to a therapist. once to my cousin when we were drunk, and once to my best friend. i still have such shame about what happened and i don't know why because it was the right choice and i would never judge someone else for doing what i did. but i fucking hate myself for it. and i hate him for putting it inside of me and never even knowing and telling me i was a stupid bitch for thinking he could get me pregnant by forcing himself on me without a condom. i hate him for violating me and then laughing at me about it. i hate his roommate for telling me to shut up and stop crying as i laid next to him in that tiny dorm bed, frozen in place and having no other options. i hate him for continuing to touch me throughout the night despite my crying. i hate that i cannot stand to be touched now, that every arm on my shoulder or leg brushing mine is a threat.

She was good looking and popular with boys, they all kept approaching her which was a little intimidating for me if im honest.

After a while we kept going to eachothers houses after school to hangout. She was like the closest friend I'd ever had. She seemed really into fashion and kept giving me tips about what to where and so on. 

One day we arranged to go to her house and she was talking about a bra she'd designed that she wanted me to try on. I agreed and she handed me the bra and told me to put it on, i walked out of the room and got changed, then came back in wearing only the bra and my trousers, which i found a little bit wierd, but since she seemed to think it was normal i went along with it. She said it looked great and that i should try her panties with it too. This i found super wierd but she seemed super exited so i eventually agreed. When i came back in wearing only the underwear she asked if she could take some pictures. I found that wierd too but i trusted her and she was practically begging, so i agreed if she promised not to show anyone. I stood for some, then she told me to lie on her bed and do poses. (Kneeling, sitting, even bent over and squeezing my breasts which i thought was a joke at the time) I was becoming increasingly suspicious but wanted to be supportive up untill the point she took her shirt off when i became very worried. I asked what she was doing, but she shushed me and placed her phone down set on record. She climbed ontop of me and groped my breasts and pulled the panties down. She put her finger inside me and moaned. I began crying and managed to get out from under her. I grabbed my clothes and ran. 

She never spoke to me again. I see her sometimes at school. She has a boyfriend now. The thing that worries me most is that she probably still has those pictures and videos. She is increadibly popular with guys but alot of girls avoid her and her friends come and go. Sometimes i wonder if she does it to others too. ",6,0,meToo,Ell___,1,2018-10-28 00:17:23

The Whole Story,6,9knyjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9knyjz/the_whole_story/,5,1538457434.0,"Maybe this isn‚Äôt the right place for this post. Maybe no one will read it, which I suppose is fine with me. Maybe no one will care, maybe saying it anonymously defeats the purpose. I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs not my point in telling my story in its entirety. I‚Äôve never told anyone more than a piece or two. No one knows the whole story, and, at least for my own sanity, I need the whole thing out there at once, in full. I apologize that it‚Äôs so long.

I was thirteen, several weeks before I turned fourteen and started my freshman year. It was summer. My friends and I were walking at night. It was dark, but not terribly late. Some unknown guys were slowly following the three of us down the street, shouting things from their open windows at us. A Suburban cut in front of their car and pulled over to us. Four boys were inside. I knew them. They were two grades above mine, friends with my brother in the same year. They asked if we wanted to get in the car and get away from the unknown harassers. So we did. The unknown was scaring us, and these boys were safe.

They said they were headed to a popular spot everyone our age would go to when they didn‚Äôt know where else to hang out. My friends agreed. I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt mind. I didn‚Äôt want to go home yet, and I was pleased to be hanging out with my brother‚Äôs friends without him. Maybe I‚Äôd get the chance to be their friend, too, and not just be his little sister forever.

We arrived at the spot, and things were fine. My two friends and two of the boys walked off into the woods a little ways to smoke some pot. It wasn‚Äôt something I had really done before, so I didn‚Äôt want to go. I wasn‚Äôt very ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù in pretty much anything at that point: I didn‚Äôt know much about sex, had only kissed a couple of boys, never had a boyfriend, never been inebriated (on anything). I was shy and self-conscious to the point of near silence most of the time. I got nervous about saying the wrong thing to the remaining two boys, who were joking and horsing around with each other, so I wandered off in the other direction while I waited for everyone to come back together. 

I didn‚Äôt go far. The lights from the main parking area were still visible, but there were still plenty of dark, hidden spots. I found myself in one when the two boys who stayed behind suddenly appeared. They came close, one in front and one behind. They began touching me, softly at first, then more forcefully, but never violently. They said I was pretty, and we should have some fun. They pulled me to the ground until I was lying on the dirt and twigs and fallen leaves. They were both on their knees, one at my head, firmly holding my upper arms, the other at my feet. I asked to be let go. They laughed and said don‚Äôt worry, I was really going to like this. The boy at my feet pulled down my pants, and then my underwear. He started performing oral sex. I didn‚Äôt move. My whole body was stiff. They played football for our state champion high school team. I knew I couldn‚Äôt fight them. If I tried, if I screamed, if I tried to make it stop, what would they do? I already asked them not to, to release me, and yet here I was.

Eventually they heard the rest of the group returning and immediately stopped. They told me to get up and put myself together. They were smiling when they said they wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone if I didn‚Äôt. One winked and put his arm around my shoulders to lead me back to the car. My whole body was trembling. The stoned kids didn‚Äôt notice.

I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I didn‚Äôt think it was worth it, because I thought that‚Äôs just how these things worked. I considered myself lucky that they didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I didn‚Äôt want to be one of those girls people talked about. I didn‚Äôt want to have a reputation. For the longest time, I knew I wasn‚Äôt okay with what happened, but I thought that it was normal. When I figured out what happened wasn‚Äôt okay, I became terrified to tell anyone. I didn‚Äôt want people questioning what I had done to provoke it. I didn‚Äôt want my parents knowing I was involved in anything like this. I didn‚Äôt want to be hated for saying something against these popular, well known, ‚Äúimportant‚Äù boys in the community. I was ashamed that I hadn‚Äôt done more for myself.

It took me years to realize that I had no knowledge of how to handle such a situation because I was still a child. In those years, I also learned how to use my voice, both to exercise control of my body and to help others. I wouldn‚Äôt say my experience ruined me. It made me stronger, but I still don‚Äôt want to tell anyone. I still don‚Äôt want anyone to know. My brother is still friends with one of those boys. He‚Äôs married now, living in the suburbs of a large city a state over. He and his pretty wife just had a baby, a little girl. I helped pick out a gift because my brother was ‚Äúlost when it comes to things like that.‚Äù

That moment did not define my life, but I will never forget it. I remember everything. I remember how they smelled and the clothes they were wearing. I remember their smiles and their hair and the words they said. I remember their touch and voices. I remember the pure terror and helplessness. I still do not like to be touched by most people if I don‚Äôt initiate the contact, and I haven‚Äôt been back to that spot in almost twenty years. I‚Äôm not ruined, but I am changed.

I know this is not the worst thing that could have happened to me, and pales in comparison to so many others. But that‚Äôs my story, all of it, told for the first time. Thanks for giving me a place to tell it.",6,0,meToo,FinallyMyTruth,1,2018-10-02 08:17:14

\---

I met the man who would later sexually abuse me when I was a freshman in high school.  I must've been either 13 or 14 at the time.  I was over at my friend Lisa's\* house for a sleepover for her birthday.  She invited 3 girls over to her house, including myself.  I can't remember most of the night, but I remember meeting her older brother, who was 11 years older than us, either 25 or 26.  He was living in the house, selling knives door-to-door and a drunk.  We all sat on the front porch of Lisa's house and talked for hours that night.  Her brother, Matt\*, drank alcohol and bragged to us that he was a master of mind-games and manipulation and tried to pry secrets out of the two other girls who were there with Lisa and I that night.  I remember him telling us that he felt pathetic to be in his mid-twenties, living at home, and spending a weekend night with a bunch of teenage girls.  We comforted him in that moment, but I also remember feeling creeped out by the way he bragged about being manipulative.

Lisa soon became my best friend and we were close throughout high school.  We were inseparable.  I spent the night at her house almost every weekend, in the spare bedroom, since she often kicked and snored in her sleep.  Over time, I warmed up to her brother, who bonded with me over how we liked to go shooting at the nearby skeet range and went with Lisa and I to go country-line dancing on Sunday nights, when kids under 18 were allowed into the dance hall for Family Night.  He taught me how to swing dance; afterwards, we'd all go to the Wendy's nearby and buy Frosty's.

I felt that Lisa's family was as close to me as my own.  We went on vacation together, once to Vail and another time to Hawai'i.  Matt and Lisa were there for my brother's 9th birthday.  Lisa was the one who always stood by me, even in my awkward freshman phase when I was acne-riddled and dorky, and was the person who introduced me to Victoria's Secret and makeup.  After the summer of sophomore year, I was finally able to figure out how to dress myself, style my hair, and wear contacts.  I had friends who didn't recognize me - I remember one said, ""Woah, Kat\*, you got HOT"".  I had my first boyfriend and first kiss soon after, to be quickly dumped after a month.  I had a rough home life during my high school years and the anxiety I had represented itself as anorexia.  Part of the reason ""I got hot"" was undoubtedly because I had lost a lot of weight.  I asked my boyfriend at the time to make sure I ate when we were together since a doctor had pointed out to me that I'd lost 30 pounds over the course of little more than a month.  He had a look of shock on his face when I brought it up and he dumped me a few days after.  Lisa was there for me during that time, too.  So was Matt, saying that I deserved to be treated much better, that I was beautiful, and that he would be there for me, always.

The Fall of my and Lisa's junior year in high school quickly became the most difficult time of my life.  In quick succession of one another, my mother left our house and divorced my father and Lisa's mother suffered an aneurysm that had her on the brink of death and in a coma for a week.  At that time, I quickly assumed a parental role over my brother as my mom did not come back for months, and my father coped with the divorce by going on long, extended business trips for weeks.  I was in school and working part-time to afford gas, and sometimes used my money for food and little treats for my brother, since my dad often  mentioned that he was short on cash.  At the same time, I was going over to Lisa's house to help with laundry and bring over dinners since I knew that neither Matt or Lisa knew how to keep up housework.  At one point, the stress of it all led me to run away to Lisa's house for three days with my phone turned off and under the bed so I couldn't be contacted.  Lisa was hardly ever there, she coped by spending time with her boyfriend.  Matt was the one to comfort me.

I vividly remember the nights I spent at home, awake with fear.  Whatever anxiety and depression I was suffering had also given me night terrors, which felt indistinguishable from real life.  Alone in the house with only my brother, I dreamt that buglars had broken into our house to rape me, kill me, and kill my brother.  Each time, it was a variation of being raped in front of my brother, him being killed in front of me and then me being raped, or being raped by several men while my brother was asleep in the next room, before being killed.  I would lie awake at night, paralyzed by fear, especially when my dogs barked, alerting me that \*maybe\* they weren't barking at rabbits in the backyard, but at men who wanted to hurt my brother and I.  There were nights I would sit in front of my brother's room with a baseball bat in my hands, fearfully waiting for buglars to come up the stairs and attack me.  I at least wanted to protect my little brother, who I was raising like a son.  I felt that there was no one I could call; my dad was states away and my mother was MIA.  Until one night after months of this going on and I was overcome with terror, I called Matt to ask him to sleep on the couch.  I told him I'd give him some of my dad's brandy for the favor.

Matt came over and I felt so much safer having a man in the house.  He poured us each a glass of brandy and told me to relax.  That night, he made out with me on the couch before we went up to my room and made out on the bed.  He wanted to have sex, but I said no.  The next day, I felt a mix of incredible remorse and love.  I called Matt and told him that I wanted to tell Lisa what had happened.  He told me that I could never tell Lisa or anyone what happened since, if Lisa found out, she would never be my friend again.  He said that she would throw me away, but would never throw him away, since he was her brother.  Because of this, I didn't tell Lisa, or anyone, but felt that it was our secret.  I called him several more times when I was scared, and he'd come over.  He'd pour us drinks and expect a blow job in return for his time.  I didn't mind, since, in my mind, he was my future husband who'd always protect me.  The nights I'd call him and he didn't answer, left me feeling desolate and terrified, but the nights he did, I felt safe and loved.

The first time Matt strangled me was when we were at his and Lisa's house.  I remember being on a recliner and him asking me to blow him, since Lisa was upstairs asleep.  I said I didn't want to since she was in the house.  He got mad, and strangled me.  I don't remember anything aside from knowing he did this, since I think I blacked out.  When I woke up, I told him that he could never do that to me again or else I would never talk to him again and I'd tell his sister.  This time, he told me that he'd kill me if I ever told anyone.

I have a better memory of when he strangled me in my parent's basement.  We were listening to records and he told me to blow him as a birthday present.  He grabbed me by the neck, picking me up off the floor by my throat.  I remember grasping at my neck and freezing up with fear.  He put me down before I blacked out and I said nothing.  After that, I would still go out with him and treat him the same.  Oftentimes, when I was sleeping over at Lisa's, he'd sneak into the spare bedroom and grope me and pressure me into having sex with him until he fell asleep.

I moved to California and started college and kept in touch with him, always regarding him as my first love and a close friend.  Immediately after high school ended, though, Lisa stopped talking to me outright.  She never returned my calls and wasn't there on the day I moved.  However, with Matt, we'd spent hours on the phone.  Once at college, he pressured me to invite him to my sorority's formal, which I felt weird about doing, but eventually agreed to.  Soon after, though, some sorority sisters of mine pointed out to me how weird it was that a 18 year old would be taking a 29 year old  to the formal.  He also wanted to sleep in my dorm room with me, which was a small room where I had two other roommates.  I called him and told him I didn't want him to come anymore.  He responded by absolutely eviscerating me verbally.  He threatened to kill me and then himself.  I remember sobbing in my car minutes before I went to work.  I called Lisa and left a message, telling her that I was scared for her brother and that he said he was suicidal.  She never returned my call and I never heard from either of them ever again.

What's honestly most disturbing to me about all of this is that I found it perfectly normal for years.  The same year Matt threatened to kill me for not taking him to a dance, I took a 12-week long class about sexual assault and still did not connect the dots.  It wasn't until I was 20 years old and I went through a 65-hour certification to be a crisis advocate that someone described what grooming is and how strangulation is a form of assault that I finally realized that what I went through was sexual abuse.

I still have a hard time describing that whole sequence of events.  I don't know if it all makes me a survivor of sexual assault, an adult molested as a child, or a victim of intimate partner violence.  I *felt* like an adult while it was all happening; then again, he would always tell me he saw me as an adult, not a child.  I don't know what I would do if I was put in the same situation again.  It hurts to think about the girl who was so terrified of the threat of brutal danger that she'd welcome someone abusive over time and time again, because even that provided her some safety and some misplaced feeling of love.

I've never reported or really told anyone, not because I don't think I'd be believed - I haven't even thought that far -, but because I don't want to tear their family apart.  I guess some part of me still cares.  Some part of me wants to let it go.  Some part of me knows that nothing could be done about it anyway, but another part of me feels like he'll undoubtedly assault someone else if he hasn't already.  I wonder if I could be blamed.  Overall, I feel ashamed.",4,0,meToo,taurustangle113,1,2018-10-01 08:33:53
Hi.,5,9k60gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9k60gq/hi/,0,1538310651.0,"## Part I

I think it's time for me to add my story to the discussion. This is incredibly difficult, but it is necessary. Both for healing and to help continue the momentum that is bringing others forward.

I was a victim of repeated sexual assault as a child at the hands of my father. This is the first time that I have publicly spoken about my abuse.

I was groomed both emotionally and physically, sexually molested, shown child pornography, and fear I was even made to appear in some videos alongside a cousin.

\---

My father had been a heavy meth and cocaine addict for decades before I was born. I witnessed his firsthand and nonchalant drug use regularly as a young child. From the time I was 8 he had committed the vast majority of his free time to Narcotics Anonymous. He became so addicted to the program itself that often the majority of my time with him was spent at NA meetings, listening to the horrific stories of other addicts. There was often an element of childhood abuse among those voices. Many of which echoed my own, though I wouldn't realize it at the time.

When I was 12, I suffered a brown recluse bite that went untreated until it became a large, gangrenous abscess and I was unable to stand or walk. My father took me to the ER, and I was told I needed immediate surgery to remove it. My father's dark sickness and his zealous interpretation of NA's principles led him to tell the responding doctor that no anesthetic of any kind could be used for the surgery. Should they refuse, he would carry me out of the ER immediately. My father, who usually maintained an outwardly kind demeanor, was a powerful and very intimidating man when he wanted to be.

I don't envy the medical staff that participated in the surgery, or the nightmares they certainly have from that day. In retrospect, that doctor made the right decision, and may very well have saved my life in exchange for five minutes of agony. I was held down by two or three male nurses, while my father put his weight on my chest. The moment the doctor cut into me with his scalpel was the worst, most searing pain I had ever felt in my life. I screamed and cried, but the doctor assured me he was finished with the scalpel. When he pressed against my leg to drain the abscess, the pain was unbearable. I screamed until my throat felt bloody, begging and pleading for them to stop. This went on for several minutes, which felt like an eternity of living hell.

I couldn't comprehend why they wouldn't stop, nor why the dozen other people within earshot wouldn't save me from my torturers. Survival instincts kicked in, and I began to plead with the bystanders. If any of them attempted to do anything to intervene, they failed. I felt abandoned, doomed.

The doctor proceeded to insert a metal instrument into the abscess, which he then used to scrape away any remaining gangrenous flesh from my leg. This took less than a minute, but the pain was so completely, wholly blinding that I was in and out of consciousness. Whenever I caught a few seconds of lucidity, I was certain I was going to die.

Of all the memories of abuse at the hands of my father, that barbaric surgery is the one where every terrifying second is vividly burned into my mind forever.

I've spent the majority of my adult life regularly seeing therapists. I don't think I'd ever have made it this far otherwise. Therapists over the years have diagnosed me with PTSD, caused by the repeated physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of my father, in particular this incident.

\---

I rationalized and repressed many things about my father's abuse all the way up until my late 20s. My wake up call was when he took a near-homeless teen girl with a drug addiction and a little girl of her own into his new apartment.

The moment I saw the belongings of a young child in my father's home, I had a sinking feeling in my stomach yet couldn't make sense of it. But upon seeing a pair of familiar hard drives on his desk, I was instantly overwhelmed by disgust, fear, and a flood of awful memories of their contents. Thousands upon thousands of photos and videos of abused children, to which my father would ""accidentally"" leave shortcuts on my desktop when I was a child. Unlike his beloved ""banned books"" collection, would never sit down and share them with me directly.

Somehow, I managed to stammer my way out of the encounter. And suddenly, so many awful truths were instantly clear. Why my dad constantly needed to upgrade his hard drive space ""for work"", when he never ever worked from home. Why whenever he brought me to see my cousin and her father, I was filled with a fear I didn't understand. Why there were naked pictures of her in his email, and why he left that open for me to see. Why he had previously adopted another runaway teen, who he later let back into his life once she had two small daughters of her own. Why I hadn't ever been able to square the sexual things he did to me as a child with the concept of a pedophile. Why when I was finally old enough to question all the child pornography and report it to an adult, he had a well prepared story that I bought hook, line, and sinker.

That day was the last time I ever spoke to my father. He clearly understood, and never tried to reach out to me again beyond a single text message. Yet even though all these realizations came at once, it took a long time to come to terms with and accept who my father was, the harm he had caused to myself and others, and the continued danger that he represented. Thanks to a therapist in San Francisco, after a while I finally felt ready to come forward and contact the police in San Diego.

I was blessed to have a career sex crime fighter in my rolodex. I told them my story and they offered me wonderful counsel before passing my case on to the SDPD. I gave the responding officer the same detailed report I've given here (though if I recall correctly, not including the surgery). The officer later explained that the statute of limitations had elapsed, and that there was nothing that could be done. When I pressed about the safety of the teen mother and her child, I was told that because I could not produce the exact address of my father's apartment that the police would be completely unable to investigate. The officer was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why the police could not obtain my father's address given the serious allegations I'd made of an actively dangerous person. The case ended there.

I was devastated. I struggled, and still struggle, with intense feelings of guilt over that failure. What if I had reported him sooner? What if, like now, I had gone public sooner? Has he harmed anyone else? Is he hurting someone right now? These questions will haunt me for the rest of my life.

\---

2018 started off as a rough year for me, and I struggled with depression. Everything looked perfect: Great job, stable relationship, bright future. Yet I was paradoxically feeling less and less fulfilled.

Against my better judgement, I have occasionally checked public records for information about my father, who has a predictably messy legal history. In May, I discovered my father‚Äôs name on the sex offender registry. I was *destroyed*. The feelings of intense guilt and anxiety I‚Äôd worked so hard to manage over the years came flooding back in full force, and I had my first severe panic attack in several years.

My anxiety quickly spiraled out of control, I broke up with my girlfriend, and I took a leave of absence from work. I began to drink heavily, sometimes drinking an entire fifth of whiskey in a day. I would often wake up in the morning, then take a shot of whiskey so I could go back to sleep rather than face the anxiety over my father. After a couple of weeks I began to accept that I would never be the same again, and contemplate the idea of simply drinking myself to death.

At some point, I worked up the courage to check the full sex offender report on my father, to find out who he had harmed and how. I was shocked to discover that the photo did not resemble my father. A younger man with an identical name was the offender.

I‚Äôm still processing all of the emotions and implications of that discovery. But I knew in my gut from that point on that I would never be returning to work. I was a wreck.

To my surprise, letting go of any and all expectations for my future led to the first few moments of genuine happiness I‚Äôd experienced in weeks. My outlook began to rapidly improve, and I started venturing out into the world again. Backed by a good safety net and without any major responsibilities, I began to focus on the things that made me truly happy. It was and continues to be a transformative experience, and for the first time in my adult life has given me the perspective to understand the type of person I really want to be. Since then, I‚Äôve devoted every hour of every day to becoming that person, and I can honestly say that I‚Äôm the happiest and most fulfilled I‚Äôve ever been. I survived.

Advice on how to help a friend who has been abused,5,9i8sia,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9i8sia/advice_on_how_to_help_a_friend_who_has_been_abused/,5,1537713300.0,"Hello. I'm not quite sure how to word this but I am looking for any advice on how to support a friend who has been abused and harassed. She was already in a vulnerable place as she has been in what I can only describe as an emotionally abusive relationship with a very controlling and alcoholic partner. She is trying to break free of this relationship and I have been trying to help her where I can. But I have since found out that about a year ago her boyfriend's mum's partner put his hand down the back of her jeans and then again down the front of them. This has angered and disgusted me when the prick already knew she was in a vulnerable situation with what was going on in her relationship. The thing is I live too far away to be there for her directly and so I am looking for ways and advice to support her indirectly from distance. I have sent her links to a UK based rape counselling charity as well as to a mental health charity, as she can't afford the cost of therapy right now. I also said she should still report it even though it was a year ago, but that I could understand why she didn't and might still not be ready to do so and that it was her choice. I  hope that was the right thing to say? Also this may have no bearing on anything but I am a male, so I really don't want to make her feel that another man is trying to control her life and tell her what to do. Is there anything else I can say or do to try and help her through this situation? :-(. Thanks for any advice.",5,0,meToo,zeldaman666,1,2018-09-23 17:35:00

We had sex and I allowed it to happen. We started regularly hooking up and talking after that. I would sneak out at night to see him and we would chill in his car, listen to music, and smoke. I started having these really bad panic attacks a few times out of the blue (look up non epileptic seizures). I would black out, my body would convulse, and I couldn't control myself or see but I could feel and hear everything. I would grab at things in the car to try to remind myself of my surroundings when I would feel it creeping up on me. Eventually I would lose it though and he would hold me to try to calm me down. Then his hand would slide into my shirt. He would kiss me and undress me and have sex with me while I was ""seizing"". Eventually, I would calm down and come to and I never thought it was wrong because we ""had feelings for each other"" and he was my friend. We would still hang out or smoke and have consensual sex until it all ended a few months later. A few times during us smoking I would on and off have these panic attacks, black out, and he would have sex with me to calm me down. Another one of my friends I told a little while later pointed out to me that what he did wasn't okay. I had never thought of it that way.
I talked about it to my psychiatrist and she says I have PTSD from what he did. I have moments where my current boyfriend can't even touch me or hold my hand or I shake, cry, pull away, and get extremely scared of him. I can't watch a rape or sexual assault scene without having a panic attack. I feel ashamed talking about it to those that are extremely close to me because I don't know if I'm blowing it out of proportion and if it's my fault.

When me too was trending, I was amid a battle with my school to ban my ex from my college campus at least until I graduated. He was a recent graduate of our private Christian college that depends on graduate donations a lot so they did absolutely nothing to help me. 
I told them he raped me while I was drunk on my 20th birthday (he was sober). I told them he was rejected from our church to get his district ministry license because of an essay he wrote about his ""faith journey"" which involved ""overcoming"" several years of him sexually abusing his younger sister. I didn't feel like I would ever be heard, so I posted about it and called him out.
I've since dropped out of college but my husband still attends there. Today he let me know he ran into a pastor he grew up knowing. The pastor told him that when I posted about what happened to me it got to the heads of the church, who were reconsidering giving him his license for ministry (meaning he would be a church leader). They decided ultimately they made the right decision the first time. Even crazier is the pastor said that my ex was trying to get a position leading the youth group at his church. Yikes. 
I finally feel like he is getting real life consequences that he's never had before and I'm confident he won't be able to be in a position of leadership that might allow him access to people he could abuse. I am relieved that I seem to have made the right decision to post about it.

My parents don't know I was molested twice.,5,8y9iid,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8y9iid/my_parents_dont_know_i_was_molested_twice/,3,1531400090.0,"TLDR: Tittle says it all.

Warning y'all. This is hella long.

FIRST. When I was 5 or 6 years old my family was assigned a driver by my grandad's workplace that came in everyday and drove everyone to work or anywhere they needed to go. I grew particularly close to this driver. We became playmates, so to speak. When I get home from school he'll always be there by the drive way, waving and smiling. He was friendly, or so I thought. One day, my whole family was getting ready to go to a party at my Grandad's office, and I was done first. So I headed out to get into the car, and of course, the driver was there. That's when he stopped me. He grabbed my arm and placed my back against him. He started sniffing my hair, telling me how good I smell. He kept sniffing, then his hand moved to my neck and he started caressing it. At this point I started to wiggle away from him. But he grabbed me tighter. He then moved his hand down my pants and started rubbing me over my underwear. Being at that age I had no clue what was going on, but I could sense I was in danger. So I pushed him away and ran back in the house, with the intent of telling my parents and grandparents of what happened but that wasn't what happened. When I got to the room my mom and grandma were something happen, as if the universe played a twisted game. My mom sat me down and said, ""Now listen to mommy, you make sure that nobody touches you and your private parts. The only people allowed to touch that area is mommy and grandma when you get a potty accident."" I was surprised. I felt I had done something bad, for allowing that man touch me. I was mortified, my first thought was if they found out they'd scold me. So I kept quiet. 

Months later that driver was promoted and left his position as our driver. But before leaving he went to me and hugged me goodbye. He said he'll miss me. (Still makes my skin crawl now)

SECOND. I was in the 4th grade. Everyday I would play with a neighbor kid that didn't go to school (idk why). So everyday this kid would knock on our door and ask me out to play, he was a year younger that me. One day while we were playing I notice a man watching us. He was sitting on the ground probably a few meters away. He was ""playing"" with something in between his legs and take it out from time-to-time then hid it again. It's after i got a good look did i realize what he was playing with, YUP, his penis. My first thought was to stay calm. I didn't want to scare my friend. So I told him we should move and play somewhere else. So we did. I thought we were safe. I was wrong. The man had followed us and this time he was standing much closer to where we where and lost all effort to hide his penis. He was masturbating. At this point I told my friend what was happening. I told him to run as fast as he could back home, and we did. But the man caught me and grabbed my arm. I dont remember how I escaped his grasped, but I did. When I got home I tried telling my nanny at that time of what happened. But again, fear rushed in. So I kept quiet. I was too scared to come out and play after that. 

I had forgotten all these at one point. But the universe has a way with playing with you. When I was a sophomore in high school my family went to a bowling alley to the city I used to lived when I was younger. It was a fun and happy day. Until I saw a familiar face that caused my stomach to tie into knots. It was our old driver. He was much older, but I knew it was him way before he realized who I was. He smiled and tried to reach for a hug, but before his hands could touch me I ran off. I remember running to the washroom and cried. Still. I told no one.

I am 21 now and these events haunts me sometimes. This is also probably why I have an initial fear when it comes to men. I sometimes wonder if I should tell my parents. But for now I'm sharing it here.",5,0,meToo,heyheyshaney,1,2018-07-12 15:54:50

Was I sexually assaulted?,3,8uthbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8uthbp/was_i_sexually_assaulted/,5,1530281922.0,"Recently I have been struggling and feeling a little down as I finnished school 2 years ago and I have been unemployed the whole time. I have chosen to follow my dreams to become an airforce pilot and it is taking forever for me to get into the airforce, mainly because I had to do a math course because I didnt do the correct maths in high school. However my mother has made it clear she doesnt want to keep supporting me as I aint earning any money, I just tell her I am trying to get my dream job. So I have been living at my mothers for almost 2 years and have no social life since school finnished. This has caused me to think alot about my past.  For some reason the last couple days I have been remembering something which I have ignored my whole life and to be honest I dont know what to think of it even now. So I thought I would anonymously ask reddit for advice.

As I was growing up my Mum was a Jehovah's witness. We would go to the hall where a guy who owned the hall would read the bible. His name shall be Tom for privacy reasons. Tom seems like a nice family man, he has a wife and 3 kids, who are older than me. I remember he would help me trace my hand on paper while I sat listening to people read parts of the bible. Then a little later on my mother would take me to what was called 'bible studies'. We would sit in a circle and discuss what gods words meant throughout the bible. One time I told my mother I needed the toilet, I needed a piss. She asked Tom where the toilet was and he said he would take me and show me where it was. When we got to the toilet he came in with me. I always stood upright to piss because thats what boys do. But he made me sit on the toilet. While I pissed he crouched down so he had a line of sight on my penis and watched me pee. Then when I was finished he got some toilet paper in his hand and started wiping my penis. I remember telling him I only did a pee and didnt need to clean. He said you still need to clean when you pee aswell. 

I have never said anything about it. Never really thought about it. Is this sexual assault? 

My mother and myself are no longer religious and I am not sure why she decided that. But Tom like all Jehovah's witnesses will come and knock on our door from time to time and gives us a quick chat about god and invites us to the hall. My Mother is never interested but is always polite and listens. Sometimes I would answere the door as we never knew who it was knocking. I was also not interested but was always polite and listened. I dont know why but I have ignored what happend for my whole life, but I have been thinking about it recently.

He made sure he touched and bumped into me more often then others and then the little under the breath sexual comments started to come out. I ignored it and him for the most part.   After a few days, it started to get worse.  On the fourth day we had to attend a mandatory Harassment Seminar, which he obviously did not listen to anything said by the lawyers.  By the fourth day, I finally said to him ""I think you are flirting with me and I don't like it, please stop."" It did not help.    Now here I am, new to the dept, loving my job but left feeling uncomfortable whenever he comes around with his lewd comments.  Others hear but don't say anything.

My #MeToo,3,7kqs5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7kqs5q/my_metoo/,2,1513656413.0,"When I was 5 years old my family moved to a small town in Idaho. Me and my siblings were homeschooled, and the only friend I had was this one girl, who we'll call Sally, that went to my church. While we were friends some issues at home began to  develop. My siblings began constantly hitting me, and making fun of me. Please don't think of me as whiney, I can take a punch and words don't hurt, but this was constant, and it created a looming feeling of dread whenever I was about to do anything that could be defined as stupid. This didn't bother me too much and still doesn't bother me today, but it destroyed all the trust I had in my family, I felt like I was imposing on them to tell them any of my problems, even little details that I would just like to have someone listen to. Note: I am in no way saying my family pain is worse than anyone else's, I hit it off fairly lucky and realize that many people had horrible family's compared to mine.

Then came the day Sally invited me to her house. All was well and good, until we settled down to watch a movie. Sally's older brother, who we'll call Bob, insisted that I sit next to him, then began to complain about how cold it was, so he grabbed a blanket and placed it over the two of us. I'm sure you can guess what happened next. He started just touching me, then he began to take any opportunity to get into my pants. It got to the point where he would wait for Sally to use the bathroom, then he would bend me over and fondle me. He would touch me in my sleep, whenever sally wasn't looking he would grope me. All the while he told me it was a normal thing people did, and that my family would ""hate"" me if I whined about something like that. I was only 5, I believed him. This went on till mid 2014 (6 years). As I got older he began to threaten me more about telling on him. It all ended when he got a girl from his high school pregnant and he left the church along with his family. 

To this day I have only told one person, my best friend, who has been dealing with a whole different form of sexual harassment. (Nothing physical, I'm not letting anything like what I went through happen to her) my family is blissfully unaware and I'm not planning on telling them or anyone else anytime soon. My ""me too""  has burdened my life so much, it crippled my self worth, and has given me a lot of mental problems that I will get therapy about as soon as I'm out of the house. My experience has ruined everything in my life that made me happy, it took me 3 years to make another close friend and made me generally hate everyone who I couldn't go to for help during that time. I can't wait to leave my home and find some people who can help to bring back some of my early happiness.

It‚Äôs been four years
Haven‚Äôt given you much thought
But today my world fell apart because of you

It took four years
Someone finally put a word to it

A casual conversation 
An offhand comment
Of a 15 year old girl trying to tell and 18 year old boy no

Reliving that moment in the park
I can still hear the children laughing

The shame that started that day never left
It burned my cheeks as I walked home
Legs covered in my own blood
It gripped my throat when I wanted to tell another no
Laughing on my shoulder as I give away my self respect

Rape

After four years there‚Äôs the word 
In all its ugly glory

I said no to the word rape
Pushed it away

me too.,5,786nq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/786nq3/me_too/,0,1508751968.0,"The first time I was sexually assaulted, I was in elementary. One of the kids my age thought it would be fun to ‚Äúplay adult‚Äù and I had to make out with them and got fingered. 
When I was in junior high, my first boyfriend forced my first kiss on me. I ran away crying and got made fun of the next day for not wanting to kiss my own boyfriend.
The next boyfriend I had groped me regularly. I told him no and pushed him away regularly, but my objections never changed his actions. 
In my first year of high school, a boy who was a year older than me told me he needed some help moving chairs in the other room. I thought I was so cool- helping out an older boy. Once he had me alone, he cornered me and began undressing me. I was lucky enough at that time to be physically fit, as well as in a good position to kick him in his privates. I ran away. I told a teacher the next morning. She went to the school board and asked them if anything could be done, but ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt get far enough‚Äù for there to be actions taken against him. I later confided in my older sister. He got scolded by her and eventually apologized to me saying it was all a misunderstanding. I spent the next 3 years having to be in around him all the time. After everyone forgot what had happened, they all became good friends with him and so he started sitting with my friends during lunch. So I isolated myself to get away from him. I still feel nauseous when I see a picture of him.
My second year in college I went on a first date with a guy. It was late at night because I had class till 9pm. We drove from my school to the beach, and I felt sick most of the hour long trip there. Now I believe my body was trying to warn me. I was on medication that had been prescribed to me a few months though, and hadn‚Äôt been alert in any way since I began taking it. So I ignored my instincts. We walked around the beach for a while before he asked me to come to his place to watch Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off. I loved the movie so I agreed. That night I remember the sound of Disneyland‚Äôs fireworks going off. I remember wishing that I was there instead, all while getting assaulted. Afterward I begged him to take me back home, so he did. I told people I was close to that next day what happened. I got taken to my school‚Äôs health office, but all they could do was encourage me to press charges and to get a rape kit done. My sister took me to the hospital to get it done (since my school doesn‚Äôt do them), but I was going to have to wait for hours. I was embarrassed and exhausted so I convinced her to just take me back to my dorm. A week later I asked my roommate if it was normal to bleed after the first time having sex. Apparently not for that long. I also had bruises all over my body for a long time from that experience. I also received threatening and sexual texts and calls from him for month after that experience, all of which I diligently ignored. After that I had sensitive spots all over my body even though there was medically nothing there. 
My third year of college, I got into a relationship with a boy who I thought was amazing. I practically worshipped the ground he walked on! He was everything I wanted in a partner. Yet after a few days into our relationship, he began forcing me further and further into sexual acts despite me telling him I didn‚Äôt even feel comfortable making out. He was in the Army though, so I could never get out of his grips. He abused me physically, mentally, financially, and sexually. He did things to me that I wouldn‚Äôt dare even tell myself about again. Although I had always been verbal when things happened, I learned to keep my mouth shut with him. I learned what real fear was. So I didn‚Äôt mention it to anyone till I was in therapy last week and accidentally let it slip. 

Reading all of the ‚Äúme too‚Äù posts triggered me severely. For the first few days I just avoided the internet completely. Yet I soon realized, after several of my friends confessed to me what happened to them (having found bravery in themselves through all of the posts), that the posts are encouraging people and empowering us. I have always been very verbal about everything because I wanted to fight the culture of silence that is surrounding sexual assault. Yet after the last one, I admit that I finally learned my place. 
Yet I found courage, too, in the ‚Äúme too‚Äù posts. I am posting this to give courage to people who are just trying to make it through the day without a panic attack, because I too have been there. I am posting this to show that this kind of behavior (sexual assault) is hand fed to even young children. Even the events that happened to me as an adolescent, although at the time they did seem small and I thought I was overreacting, they led me to become a 20 year old woman who was overwhelmingly unsurprised when I got raped by the person I was dating, and even accepting of it (noting that this was just the way that life is). I am posting this to say that THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH GETTING PHYSICALLY CLOSE TO ANYONE WHO IS CLEARLY UNWILLING. I am posting this for the person who has been sitting in class for the past half hour and unable to breath, can‚Äôt stop looking over their shoulder, is freaking out because someone‚Äôs elbow just brushed up against their arm, is having flashbacks because the day and time and weather are all so similar to a memory, who avoids certain places, who has lost a deep connection with their family because they will never be able to communicate to their family what happened, who can‚Äôt talk to their friends anymore because of certain glaring similarities between their friends and their attacker, and who is going on a first date with a guy and having a panic attack because they don‚Äôt want to get raped again. You are valid in your fears. And there are resources all over the internet if you need help to come down from your PSTD or depression or anxiety. You are strong because you are going through war and surviving. I believe in you, because I am unbelievably weak yet have grown and healed in ways that I thought were not possible. I have no doubts that you will go even further in healing and do even more in your life than you can imagine right now; because I myself have experienced that kind of healing. And I am impressed by you. I am excited for what lies ahead in your path. We are all excited to see the you that unafraid and unashamed. ",5,0,meToo,eggshellgirl,1,2017-10-23 12:46:08

I read a few of the threads on this sub and I would like to ask a simple question ..

So many of the threads here seem to be a woman and she's in some situation, and some guy does something awkward / creepy, but she doesn't want to raise a fuss, isn't exactly sure what he meant, was kind of uncomfortable, left it alone, saw him again, etc, etc .. it's like this escalation of creep where she keeps not saying anything, keeps saying she wasn't sure what he meant, he touched her hair, tickled her, put his hand on the small of her back, looked into her eyes and said something weird, or just on and on ... and some of this stuff seems to go on over multiple encounters.  One girl was talking about her boyfriend escalating things, another about a friend from high school.

So here's the thing ... if somebody walked up behind me, put their body against mine, smelled my hair ... dude I would NOT be like "".. and I didn't want to say anything because I thought he might just have been being friendly ..."" or some shit, I'd be like DUDE GET THE F&\^% OFF OF ME BEFORE I SLAP THE EVER LOVING SHIT OUT OF YOUR ASS AND MAKE YOU CRY FOR YOUR F&\^%ING MOTHER""

So my question is, WTF, why do women even BS around in these kinds of situations, I mean, how do you even end up being in the same room with the same creepy ass shit over and over again, or end up in the same car with a boyfriend you know wants more and is escalating this shit, or etc ... I realize sometimes it can't be helped if you're very young, but even then, can't you be like ""Dad, this dude keeps trying to touch me"" or something ?

This is NOT ""victim blaming"", I'm just honestly wondering WTF is going on in a woman's head that she doesn't just slap the shit out of somebody for touching her inappropriately, or at least being like ""DON'T EVER F&\^%ING TOUCH ME AGAIN"" with her finger pointed in his face or something.

Okay, now I remember how I got here, it was an article about Joe Biden being creep to some woman, inhaling the scent of her hair from behind, kissing her on the head ... I mean seriously, if some old dude tried to kiss me on the head I'd do some crazy ass creeped out contortion with my back trying to get away and be like ""DUDE WTF ARE YOU DOING SMELLING MY HAIR AND TRYING TO KISS ON THE HEAD F&\^%WAD, KEEP YOUR FU&\^ING HANDS OFF ME""

I just don't understand how women even end up in these BS situations, especially when some dude is sending signals, escalates it on multiple occasions, etc ... why not just tell the dude to go f&\^% himself.",4,0,meToo,Tectrac,1,2019-03-30 18:05:25

When I was in high school freshman year I was in advanced placement for math and science so I had class with people older then myself I sat in a bath class next to a boy who was totally my type.... dark hair dark eyes chiseled jawline not built but not skinny or fat either..... he was bout 5‚Äô4‚Äù only a year older then me... I instantly was attracted and told him so he ignored me.... we had class together for three years in a row for math and music... 

So we became close friends I would always ask him if he was interested in trying one just one date and he always said no I wasn‚Äôt his type cause I was goth and he was Uber religious...... he would date any girl who looked like me as long as they were religious...... but break up with them after a month or so and come crawling to me for comfort...... so one day I gave up, I invited him to play cards and he said he didn‚Äôt wanna so I said ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt wanna be led on, so I‚Äôm done here, your great but it hurts to see you date other people‚Äù 

Few days later he went thru a depression stage and then came crawling to me and begged me to try and date him that GOD told him I was his soulmate and he was making a mistake letting me go.


So we started dating year four of being friends and class mates..... first 5 months were a dream.....

But month 6 he started questioning everything I did asked for my phone to check it or asking for my social media logins... he told me stop hanging with my friends cause they were not happy with us dating.... he told me to come to his house cause he didn‚Äôt think my parents liked me and his parents wouldn‚Äôt bother us cause he knew they didn‚Äôt like me (cause I am white passing) 

A friend helped me to break up with him when he requested I quit all my school clubs and transfer out all classes with male teachers...... (most teachers at the school were male) 


Then dumb me after two months broken up got back with him..... for the life of me I don‚Äôt know why I legit thought he changed and I think it was cause I was soo focused on stupid shit I didn‚Äôt wanna look at him for what he was.....


So we start dating again and 6 months in it‚Äôs around thanksgiving I try to feed him cake while he plays final fantasy..... he made us eat thanksgiving dinner in my bedroom away from my family so ‚Äúwe‚Äù could game while we ate....... I put a bit more then a bite on the fork of cake and he threw me into my bedroom wall for getting some on his nose and ‚Äúembarrassing him‚Äù when it was just us in the room.....


I blamed myself for being hit I hid the hole in my bedroom wall with a poster and said nothing bout the bruise except that I fell.... 

Then month 8 I was watching TV with him at my parents on the couch next to my mom.... he kept pushing me under the blanket on his lap insisting I touch him next to my mom on the couch so playfully I bit him and said no... he throws me on the floor and kicks me IN FRONT OF MY MOM! And calls me a fucking bitch and walks out.... I‚Äôm in pain and shock my mom can‚Äôt move she is stunned.....


She says she won‚Äôt tell my dad cause my dad will kill him or my brother for same reason..

Next day I ask why he keeps hitting me he explains it‚Äôs ‚Äúreflex‚Äù and that his dad hits his mom and he never really ‚Äúhit hit‚Äù me but that he wouldn‚Äôt do it again if I didn‚Äôt like it....

Two weeks go by and during the two weeks I have weird feelings cause he would pick me up give me fast food then I would fall asleep in his car and he would drive me home... it wasn‚Äôt till week three of this I woke up in his car to him parked outside our high school drama club windows with me naked in the front seat and him on top of me touching and licking me...... I was 17 almost 18 I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening when I woke up so I hit him and he says ‚Äúoh you can hit me but I can hit you! Fuck that!‚Äù And drives me still in shock to a movie theatre near by and rapes me in the parking lot taking my virginity while homeless men stood outside the car watching and touching themselves....... 


When I got home I laid in the bath tub wondering if I would get pregnant with my rapist boyfriends baby or should I kill my self in the water so no one finds out I‚Äôm unclean......... my mom found me laying in the tub dead eyes hours later and apparently knew she came to the cold water and told me how her boyfriend picked her in his house and raped her repeatedly for two days when she was my age so she knew my look..... she informed me she got pregnant from her rape and aborted it....... she also said she would help me escape him.....


It‚Äôs been 13 years since my mom helped me break it off with him and this man still stalks me he only dates girls who look like me now too... those girls message me cause he talks bout me like we still see each other he sends me random messages from alt facebooks with photos of his kids saying ‚Äúthis could of been what our baby looked like if you kept your mouth shut and took it like you should of‚Äù 


I reported my rape with my moms help he got 2 months in jail cause we were dating and the judge said ‚Äúyou probably instigated it‚Äù 

I got a restraining order long enough to start working in hair salons now he finds out where ever I work and comes in to get hair cuts to see if I‚Äôll lose my job by freaking out on him at work..... police won‚Äôt do anything anymore bout it....... only good thing is last December he moved out of state so I‚Äôm hoping he won‚Äôt every pop into my life again ",3,0,meToo,kaleidoqueef,0,2019-03-15 17:30:50

about my prof (I don't know if this belongs here),3,ai6341,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/ai6341/about_my_prof_i_dont_know_if_this_belongs_here/,0,1548042561.0,"as the title explains, i don't know if this belongs in this thread because i never had it as bad as some who's posted here and i don't want to make a mockery of this thread. and i still don't know how i feel about what happened and i don't know what i want from sharing this with you. this is long but here goes.

in 2014 i was a freshman at university. i was having troubles in my classes because i wasn't ready to be on my own and i just never had the skills to study for that level. although i was having troubles in my core courses (those related to my would-be profession until i dropped out/got kicked out) it was a class and one professor that made me feel disgusted with myself.

she taught my speech communications course (class size of \~30, very small for uni), a course that related to nothing of my profession but was deemed a necessity for all faculties because our uni feared that the ""quieter"" fields wouldn't speak ""good"". in the very first class, she told us to stand up and introduce ourselves. Being really nervous and friendless in the class, i made a fool of myself and spoke fast and too loud and was a bit flamboyant and nervously laughed a bit. you'd think that was it but she then made each student write a review of each student's introduction. just an adjective to describe the student. She then collected the papers and picked some to, imo, criticize the students because she certainly did that with me. i remember vividly how much objection and unwanted sympathy was in her voice when she told me that some of my classmates thought i was ""bubbly"". like it was the worst characteristic of all. especially when it wasn't even accurate. like i said i was nervous. you'd think there was some point to why she did that exercise except there wasn't. she told us what our classmates thought about us and explained the syllabus and that was the end of class. i'd thought she'd at least connect it to how first impressions matter by she didn't. throughout her class it was obvious to us through after class murmurs that we didn't take her class seriously. that a group of students at least felt that she had favourites and was sexist and stereotyping asian students as quiet but good students that were in dire need of her communication teachings. but everyone tried to stay on her good side. we were all freshman and determined to not flunk out of our program. it's funny because there was a time when she asked what we thought of her and this one student said he felt we had to abide by her rules because she was the one giving us our marks. unlike math, or any subject that has a clear right and wrong answer her communication class was based on her perception of how she thought your speech/performance/writing was. even with the rubric, talking to other students i got the sense that we all felt she was going more by own feeling than actually following the rubric. 

she continued to pick on me. one time this really annoying girl sitting next to me was talking to me and she laughed at something she was saying and i was spaced out to and when the prof caught her and asked for what was so funny the annoying girl just pointed at me. yes. actually pointed at me like a 3rd grader tattling on another student. i was pretty much doomed in her class because everything i did got picked on. and no student really wanted anything to do with me. i'm guessing they didn't want to be associated with someone who the prof hated. we were all freshmen. scared and unsure about everything. i don't blame any of them. there's always been a ""trouble kid"" in my class since elementary school and it just so happens my first time and one time being one is in this class. my relationship with her never improved. i cried and told my parents how alone i felt at uni and how her class seemed to make everything worse and they told me to not take it too seriously but they were concerned for me. i'm a kid of immigrants and the first to go to uni in canada. and i felt like a failure for my inability make things right. i felt everything weighed on me and this class. which in hindsight i know now, did not. 

 we submitted our first assignment and i didn't receive a good grade. it was something in the 60s and i was broken. we submitted a couple more assignments and we weren't getting our marks back so i didn't know where i was in class so i decided to ask her for help outside of class, something she encouraged her student but no one really did. but she'd praised one student that asked her for help so i thought it'd better my relationship with her if i did. i presented my topics to her for one of our assignment and she made me feel more frustrated and lost then i was before. she told me my topics were made for a male audience when our speech com class was divided with female students so it wouldn't be ideal for me to present it, even when it's a topic i liked. she left the office for something and told me to keep thinking. when she came back i presented two more that she turned her nose to and then hesitantly told me that she had to leave to catch the bus home so i had to leave her office. i left feeling like i wanted to run headfirst into our schools brick walls. it was after we got our marks back ( i got like 73 or something like) that i realized what she was looking for for the assignment. and soon after, that i realized what she wanted from her students in the course and i got an 85% average by the end. i'm not complaining about it. my social status in the course never changed. she was a strong advocate for peers giving feedback and while no one ripped into any of my speeches and presentations (i think they felt embarrassed and sorry for me tbh) i felt voiceless. i never presented my opinions in class when class participation was worth 30% of our marks. i never felt comfortable in the beginning and when she started picking on me as the class joke i felt even less so.

in the end of the course, she was doing her end of term speech and at the end she told us she wanted to hug us all. immediately i felt uncomfortable. i don't like being touched by people i don't like. yet, i lined up with all my classmates and one by one she gave us a hug and said goodbye like she was the queen addressing the luckiest of her loyal subjects. everyone was lined up. and i didn't want to be the only one who wasn't lining up for a hug because i didn't want my class to think i held a grudge and didn't like her (even though i did) least of all i didn't want her to think that. when it came time for me to hug her all i could think about was what that one boy said in class, about how she's in control of our grades and i hugged her long until she decided the hug was long enough and broke it. and that's it. there was nothing sexual but i felt disgusted. i felt like in exchange for the possibility for a good mark, i had to have bodily contact with someone i didn't want to. and with someone that some students couldn't wait to hug! 

 i've never told my mother this, i've very close to her. i never told my friends this. i told myself that i'm being overly sensitive. that there's bigger problems in the world than a student hugging a prof they didn't like and that it's my fault. i chose to hug her. sure there might have been animosity if i hadn't and she might've felt some type of way and changed my mark a bit or there might've been nothing at all. but i decided to hug her and now i have to deal with the ickiness that i feel whenever i think about it. and i could never prove anything because i ended her class with a grade so what would i say if i were to report her? i felt so powerless and for the first time i had to pretend to have physical contact with someone i didn't want to for an exchange of the possibility of something good happening to me. like i said i don't know if this belongs here in this thread. and i don't know if i want empathy or a ""lol that sucks but you weren't assaulted so stop bitching"". i just know i don't feel right about my decision. i guess you live and you learn.

her name was Karen Lazard from University of Waterloo she taught me SPCOM111 in the winter 2014 term. she has high ratings on rate my prof and she'll never face consequences for making me feel like this. and i don't know how i feel about that except that now this is on the internet and someone will read it and perhaps learn something/ or share a similar feeling. this might even give some people a good laugh at how trivial i am. and still i'm posting this.

Trying to define what happened,4,9ri66d,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9ri66d/trying_to_define_what_happened/,1,1540533875.0,"Posting this on a throwaway account. 

I'm a 19 year old female college student. This weekend, I went on a date with a PhD student at my school (27/male) that I'd met at a coffee shop a week prior. I'm still trying to piece together everything that happened, so please forgive any gaps in the timeline. 

We went for coffee and ended up going back to his place. We smoked a little bit of weed (not enough to affect me really) and then started making out. At this point, I took off my own clothes. He undressed and went down on me, and then expected me to go down on him. I stalled for a bit because I really didn't want to, but he basically pressured me into doing it. About then, I kind of dissociated from the situation, and it's taken me several days to remember all these details. 

We kept going, but as soon as we started having sex, I immediately knew this was not something I wanted to continue doing. I felt like I had gotten myself in way over my head, but I was embarrassed and didn't know how to back out, so I let him keep going. But then he started getting really rough with me. At one point, he pulled my head up by my hair, grabbed the back of my neck, and held me face down on the bed. I tried to sit back up, but he held me there. Later on, he started choking me. 

I'm a little worried because I never said anything the entire time this was happening. I never said yes or no, but I was horrified the entire time it was happening. It's really affected me, and I've had constant anxiety and panic attacks since it happened. I don't think he realizes that he did anything wrong, and I cut off contact with him the next day. 

TL;DR: Got in over my head on a hookup, he pressured me into things and became too forceful, but I was too embarrassed to tell him to stop. Was this sexual assault? ",4,0,meToo,quixotic_aquatic,1,2018-10-26 09:04:35

How to deal with trauma a decade later?,3,8nj3jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8nj3jf/how_to_deal_with_trauma_a_decade_later/,2,1527778883.0,"Hello everyone. This is really weird/hard to do, so lets just get into it. Backstory:

I had a boyfriend when I was 15. He was a year older, gorgeous and talented. As far as first boyfriends go, not too shabby. He was, however, a religious person (mormon) where I am not. We had been going out for quite a while, and being young with crazy hormones, things started escalating. I wasn't really ready for sex at that stage of my life. I told him this. I told my friends this. Yet from both him and my friends I got pressure to not be like a ""Molly Mormon"" and to do it. I was told I would be a prude if I didn't do it, no one would ever want to be with me, and he would dump me. 

I tried doing everything else under the sun with this guy to make him happy, but all he wanted was sex. I finally gave into all of the pressure and had sex with him. I felt weird, and kind of dizzy after it all happened. Like an adrenaline rush, but the nervous kind. I knew something about this situation wasn't right, but I had said yes. And it wasn't rape because I liked him. I knew him. He wouldn't hurt me. 
About a week after it happened he dumped me. I was devastated.I had told some of my friends that we had had sex, and that we had broken up. Then when school started up again, everyone found out, and I became the school slut. 
My senior year came, and I was starting to piece together what had happened. I wasn't sure if what happened to me counted as rape, since I consented, but I didn't have any other way of describing what had happened. I was talking to a friend about it, when someone overheard. This guy told me that I was making up the rape story for attention, and that he heard our sophomore year that I had had sex with my boyfriend. He said that I wanted it. 

Fast forward to now: I am a 24 year old woman, and I struggle constantly trying to define what happened to me. I feel the effects of this experience reverberating throughout my life. I have destructive tendencies when it comes to relationships, I have (undiagnosed) depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have no one to talk to about all of this. How can I move on? How can I deal with trauma that I can't put a name on? 

Help?

Lies we tell ourselves about rape,3,8je804,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8je804/lies_we_tell_ourselves_about_rape/,1,1526319626.0,"Sitting in my bathtub I contemplate how much bleach it would take and how long I would have to vigorously scrub my skin to get the feeling of him off of me.

But I sit in water far too hot for my skin, hoping that I can speed up the cellular process and that I won‚Äôt have to wait the seven years it takes to reproduce new cells, ones that won‚Äôt remember the violation.

Rape is such a complicated thing because you aren‚Äôt just fighting your assailant or the nightmares that he leaves you with, you‚Äôre fighting every single preconceived notion, every prejudice, every hang-up, every bias, every contrarian viewpoint from people who weren‚Äôt even there.

You‚Äôre fighting the beliefs and conceptions of humans that don‚Äôt want to believe that human beings can be so awful to one another. You‚Äôre fighting the convictions of people who believe they would have behaved or reacted in a manner completely opposite to how you may have reacted. Everyone can survive a zombie apocalypse until no one actually does‚Ä¶everyone would run towards the shooter, until no one actually does, everyone would rush into the burning building until no one does.

Its much easier to play the victor in our heads than it is to admit that behavior in the face of danger or fear may not always reveal what we think it does.

We‚Äôre all superhuman heroes with unlimited strength, exceptional vision and eidetic memories with an uncanny ability to recall constitutional law and exercise perfect judgement in ALL situations until were not‚Ä¶

 My older friend by 2 years came over to spend the night one night. She told me that there was this guy who had been bothering her and wanted him to stop. So in my mind I thought it would be a good idea to text him to stop. This guy was 20 almost 21. And so I do and as almost every pedophile they are good at minipulation. So we get to start talking. He said he was mine, and I his  . He told me he loved me he said we'd run away together. He said I was the most mature 13 year old he'd ever seen. He found my weeknisses and hopes against me. 
This is a few weeks after we started ""to date"" and I was such a nieve person I believed he was want me for me. In a way he was but not the way I believed. 
So after a while me and my friend at in my she's like a sister (different girl) and she's reading a texts and she makes the poing he's a pedo. I stopped talking to him than and there. But we had a game of wordle going on Facebook messenger. And my mom got on are family computer to do something and she saw it. On my dad's 49th birthday. This is when life went really down hill. I got my phone taken away. Everything was gone. I fell into deep deppression during Christmas break. I found nothing fun anymore. And so 6 months later I go to the high school band concert not expecting anything to happen I go alone. And I sit by another friend. By this point I have had deppression over this guy, tried to kill my self over this guy, hated my self over this guy, cried over this guy, felt used over this guy, and lastly I felt like I was nothing. And so the concert gose great they were amazing... It's the part after that wasn't.
So I'm over by the hall and people are gatherd in groups talking and I'm waiting for my brother to get me. I'm talking to my band director who went to it. Also I few other friends. My brother texts me it's time to go. So I go and try to leave but as soon as I get to a spot we're I was alone and i hear footsteps behind me and than quickly I feel someone 2√ó my size grab me and pull me in to the bathrooms and locks the door.... It was him. The guy. I scresmed and I yelled. And I tried. But he grabbed me slammed me to the ground (at the time I was 5,2 and 105lbs) and I couldn't get up. I walked out of the bathroom raped. No dignity. Alone. Deppresed once again. I didn't walk out feeling like oh well that I try to potray. I walked out of the feeling of being used. I wanted to die. I couldnt stand the sight of me. Currently noone knows what happened I just felt like it needed to be shared",1,0,meToo,Mabay2004,1,2018-05-04 06:10:20

"Really happy about this movement, but it comes awfully late for me as a middle-aged man.",3,7klvhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7klvhi/really_happy_about_this_movement_but_it_comes/,2,1513610896.0,"This is taken from a discussion I had this morning with my 18 y.o. son, with much more information than I gave him:

I've often bragged to myself that I've learn a lot of lessons from life by making mistakes, dusting myself off and getting back up.  To contrast, I'm really happy about the #metoo movement, for the visibility of the issues here, because learning about sex, intimacy, relationships, etc. isn't something anyone should be making a ton of mistakes on, and learning from after the fact.  The silence that has been the norm means that people like me and you get into situations that seem o.k. until the realization that it isn't, and both parties go silently their own way, in shame and embarrassment.  I've done things I regret, but tend to give myself the generous credit that they were done out of ignorance, not malice.

My first time was when I was 5 years old.  I was staying at a little girl's house while the mother watched us.  The restroom was out in the garage, and I remember yelling back to the girl outside the restroom, something like ""come look at my pee pee"", ""you'll have to see it when we get married"".  Kids, right?  No one ever talked to me about it.  I never went to her house again.  I knew it wasn't right.  But did it create even some kind of discussion?  Did anyone else's children learn from this?  No.  Over the years, I did some other inappropriate things, things I'm not proud of.

We assign responsibility to individuals when they hit 18, right?  But there is no switch that suddenly enlightens us to these issues.  The silence means many of us are learning by making mistakes - and even at best, out of ignorance.  

The last time I did something that was seriously inappropriate was about 26 years ago.  A woman that was in our group of friends was walking down the hallway, others were present, HER HUSBAND EVEN WORKED AT THE SAME COMPANY, and for some inexplicable reason, as she walked by, I cupped my hand on her butt cheek briefly.  I immediately knew I fucked up.  A friend said I could be fired, 'I know.  I just had a massive brain fart.  I can't believe I did that'.  If there was not so much silence in my life, I probably would have had more mental reserves to have stopped before I completed that action.  I've thought about punching people before too, but I've always been able to stop myself.  Punching is something people talk about, giving us time to think about it. To my benefit, the woman passed off the incident by saying 'Oh, it's just trackday'.  

I wish this movement had started when I was born, so by the time I was 5, my mother might have been more willing to say something to me about it.  My childhood was one of no discussions about sex, at all.  Even the doctor would not tell me that erections were normal and o.k. when I told him that I sometimes felt like there was a bone in my penis.  Even until later in childhood(12 y.o.), if a movie had a 'bed scene' in it, I had to leave the room.  I was threatened with punishment if I said the word 'queer', but parents refused to tell me what the evil word meant.  No wonder I had no filter when camping out with other boys, and we watched each other fart with our flashlights (at 10 yrs old?).  It went a little beyond that later, but I never touched another guys penis, just say'in for my own benefit here.

I believe this is an issue that has been with humans since before we were humans, probably as soon as we became hyper-sexed, so this change in openness is potentially a most profound change to human status-quo that may last for the rest of human existence.  I hope so.",3,0,meToo,trackday,1,2017-12-18 18:28:16

One night at a show we were all at supporting one of his artists, he asked me to come outside with him to smoke a joint. We did it all the time at work, so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Once we got out there, it was just myself and the guy-(my boss) he pulled out his penis and grabbed my hand and put it on it and told me how much he knew I wanted him and told me to get down on my knees. It was the first time in my life anyone had ever initiated anything in a sexual way towards me, I was really lucky growing up and somehow avoided terrible men until I was in college. I was embarrassed and confused (his wife was and is beautiful, and she was also 20 feet away from us on the other side of the wall) and terrified. I was drunk and stoned, and had already made arrangements to stay with them that night, which I did. I didn‚Äôt sleep for one minute that night. I stayed up waiting for him to come downstairs and rape me, which thankfully didn‚Äôt happen. I even told his wife what happened after I didn‚Äôt work for them anymore, and she just went into complete denial about it. It was crazy. ",3,0,meToo,CaitSlaght,0,2017-12-17 12:04:15

I have a few. But never posted because I feel like it's my fault.,2,7eqqpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7eqqpu/i_have_a_few_but_never_posted_because_i_feel_like/,3,1511355430.0,"First of so sorry for how long this is. 

Earliest memory I had to be in first grade. An boy my age put his hands down my pants at P.E and said he was just trying to tuck my shirt in. It shocked me but I never said anything. 

Prom I had to be about 16. It was a Christian prom and I went with this guy from church (it was his school). I didn't really like him like that but he had been obsessed with me since his childhood. We were going to an after party at about 1-2am. I wanted to change into some clothes I brought. He locked me in the car and demanded I get change in the car so he could watch me. I said no. He then locked the doors (there were no physical locks on the doors) knowing that if I still opened it from the inside that the alarm would sound and we were all trying to be really quiet because they didn't want their neighbors to call the police on the party. He also tried to make out with me multiple times in the car and I had to push him off. I tried to tell my family a little bit of it the next day and they blamed me saying that he was just trying to get into the emotions of the night and that I was ruining it. So I never spoke of it again.  

I had to be about 17 this time I was working at a fast food restaurant with a lot of less than desirable adults. One of them was rolling a blunt in the bathroom then pulled me in and began to grind on my rear I kept trying to get away but he kept pulling me back and grinding on me. I didn't see it at the time as assault because I went into the restroom so I feel like I asked  for it. 

Same restaurant different time a 34 year old man took advantage of me. He tricked me into thinking that he had feelings for me. I willingly performed oral sex on him but he lured me to his house one early morning to talk. I went. He made me suck him then he removed my pants and was begging me to let him take my virginity. I kept saying no. He kept rubbing himself on my privates and was about to stick it in anyway when a horn beeped outside. It was his sister. I remember shaking so badly but thankful that she came. I felt scared and didn't say anything because I went over there so I feel like it's my fault for going over there alone. 

The last and worst one was when I was 18. I came from a strict religious home. An abusive home. I had a fragile sense of self (still do) and just looking for someone to 'save' me. I met this guy. I had just started working there so I didn't know him that well but he was nice. He fooled me on dates etc. true southern gentleman, it seemed. He would emotionally abuse me. I willingly gave him my virginity as we are in the act it was hurting and I asked him to see if I was bleeding and he said he didn't know and just continued. He would do other things like deny me sex and make me feel bad for wanting it but if he wanted sex and I said no he would tell me I could go home. He had a ""lesbian"" friend that I didn't trust. I would go to his house and they would be laying in bed together he would be half naked. He would rub her butt a lot and they would cuddle. I caught him cheating on me on an app called whisper and he ended up threatening to leave me so I would cry and put it out of my mind so he would stay. He would guilt or threaten me( that he would leave) to have sex. And if we did I could only stay in one position and I couldn't moan or make any noise. When he finished sex was over regardless. This situation bothers me the most because I only just realized a few months ago that I think that this may have been rape.  He also caused me to leave my job because after HE broke up with ME. He got jealous when I began dating again so he spread all of my personal and sexual business around the entire store as well as photos I sent him. 

Thank you for allowing me to get all of this off of my chest. ",2,0,meToo,Disputeanocean,1,2017-11-22 15:57:10
Open Letter. #metoo,3,78cmko,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/78cmko/open_letter_metoo/,0,1508809788.0,"Metoo

Some memories are more vivid than others, some memories I did everything I could to suppress, some parts of some memories are black. Thinking of these memories leads me to remember the actions I tried to take to make sure I never had to think about them ever again. Every single person on this incredible planet has their own special story; good, bad, ugly, courageous, heart breaking, it is their own story. Here is mine

I‚Äôm Kristi. I am now 23 years old and it has been over 10 years since I was sexually assaulted for the first time. It took years for me to be comfortable being around men in uniform of authority ‚Äì cops or military men, mostly in an Army uniform. He was my best friend‚Äôs older brother. He was my older brother‚Äôs friend. He had been to my house, he knew my mom, I said my first curse word with him and my brother in his car in the parking lot of Dollar Tree. He was older, I was confused. I liked women, but couldn‚Äôt talk about it. He took something from me that I could never get back, but I thought it was my fault. I enticed him, because I thought it would be cool to kiss an older guy. I thought I would be accepted by my peers, and I thought no meant no. I thought what I said mattered, what I wanted mattered, and it didn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt cool, it wasn‚Äôt what the movies show you it is, it didn‚Äôt feel good. ‚ÄúI got this from basketball, Mommy. I‚Äôm fine Mommy.‚Äù Lie after lie after lie and eventually you just try to forget. Unfortunately, I can replay every detail in my head. But I don‚Äôt know what hurt more, him inside me and his punch to my face, or the after math it has left me with for past 11 years. Until recently, I would have a panic attack in the presence of someone in an Army uniform, I still wake up every day with TMD, and I still flinch if someone comes too close to me. He broke me for a long time, but I came out on top. I had accepted what had happened as I went on in life to learn that something like this was normal for women. I wasn‚Äôt alone, and many other women had it worse than I did.
 
Less than a year later and I am in a very similar situation with a man who was much more familiar than a friend. We left my dad for this man, he was supposed to make life better. He is the father of my mom‚Äôs first child. Joe, you were supposed to treat my family better. You were never supposed to hurt me. It shouldn‚Äôt have taken me four years to tell my mom what you did to me. You deformed me, you scarred me. I was so young, running around on your bed in your oversized T-shirt. I used to sleep there with you and my mom when I would have nightmares. I didn‚Äôt want to take a bath and I thought we were just playing. You slammed me on your bed, you grabbed my legs and pulled me close enough until you could taste me. I have spent too many years trying to suppress the memory of how hard you bit me, and the image of you pulling your head away from my body with me still in between your teeth. I was 12 years old and you ruined me. I kept quiet for years, because I was strong enough to handle it by myself. Two years later I sit my mom down and tell her ‚ÄòMommy, he hurt me.‚Äô I will never forget the face she made knowing her baby got destroyed and was silent for so long. Little did she know, she only knew about Joe. I told myself in that moment I will carry everything I experience in life, to spare my mom the heartbreak. It hurt me more to see her broken, than the physical pain you caused me. You have changed my romantic life and every type of life I have, because I don‚Äôt want anyone to get close enough to see what you did to me. I don‚Äôt look the same down there anymore. But again, I don‚Äôt know what hurt worse, the pain or the after math. 

Life went on though, I got addicted to my prescription pills, I scarred my wrists, I stopped eating, I ate too much and binged, anything to cope. 

A few years later I was 17, living back home in New York. My happy place. He was my best friend. We went on friend dates once a month to play pool, or see a movie, or go to the beach. We worked together, he was so nice. Never tried to hit on me, probably because I had a girlfriend. It was April and I was officially broken up with my girlfriend. I was wearing my favorite plaid shirt when he picked me up. We went to play pool and get a few drinks, I had a fake ID. I remember feeling so excited to get out of the house, because I was so depressed. I only had two drinks and he asked if I wanted to go watch a movie at his house, where I had never been. He was my friend, I trusted him and did not second guess his offer to hang out longer. The whole time we played pool he didn‚Äôt make a single move on me. It wasn‚Äôt too late, we get there and no one was home. We went upstairs. It‚Äôs black now. It flashes in my head like a movie scene you can only see certain parts of. I roll over and try to get away he pulls me back on the bed and I‚Äôm bleeding from his nails digging into my ribs. My mind goes black again. The next thing I remember is him on top of me my head going from one side to the other begging him to get off me. Like every other time what I had to say didn‚Äôt matter. No didn‚Äôt mean no. He pulled my pants down, his pants were down. He didn‚Äôt want to rape me, he wanted to own me. He wanted to belittle me, and he did. He took my power and my control. He degraded me, he rubbed himself all over me while having me pinned. Once he got enough he went to the bathroom, finished himself off, and said ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go.‚Äô You might be thinking ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt she grab her phone and call someone to pick her up‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhy not call the cops when she got the chance?‚Äô It‚Äôs the sense of shock that took over my body, the anxiety, the it‚Äôs his word against mine. Scratches or not, I kept quite the first couple times why would I open my mouth now. He took my dignity, but I was stronger than that.

It is six years later, and I am standing taller than I ever have. I should have spoken out sooner, I should have opened up sooner, but I didn‚Äôt. I am telling my story for the girls who are like me and aren‚Äôt strong enough to stand on their own. For the girls who need to know that they are not alone. 

I am also telling my story for me, this is me finally letting go.

I hope this helps someone,3,7720lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7720lp/i_hope_this_helps_someone/,0,1508277613.0,"This is a throwaway, btw.

I‚Äôm aware of my narcissistic tendencies. I‚Äôve been aware for about 6 years now give or take. Before I could admit to myself that I was completely self-centered, I had to admit and fix my compulsive lying. That was hard. My whole childhood and adolescent years were spent manipulating the people around me. People who hated me as well as those who loved me. Those loved ones deserved better from me and that is what led me to change‚Ä¶ at first, until I realized I had to make the change for myself. 

That leads me to this testimony. I cannot, without anonymity, tell people what I feel I am going through and I don‚Äôt think this is in any way therapeutic since writing this out just brings me more pain. As everyone shares their posts declaring #metoo, I feel a pit in my stomach. The conflict within is too much to bear. 

I was molested at my day care when I was young. Very young. Nightmares about this particular ‚Äúteacher‚Äù were common. I used to dream she was decked out in a leather corset and stockings while whipping me into submission. This was never wanted. I didn‚Äôt even know it was sexual at the time. I didn‚Äôt even know what BDSM was and I certainly had never been exposed to it. Memories from this time are unclear and there‚Äôs a lot I‚Äôm still missing as I have forced a lot of it out of mind in order to pretend I‚Äôm normal. Perhaps this led me down a path to minor sociopathic tendencies I mentioned. 

I‚Äôve told two people in my life what happened, my mom and my wife. As much as I love my mother, she let it go in one ear and out the other. Maybe she thinks I‚Äôm lying, which I can understand. That‚Äôs not to say it isn‚Äôt frustrating since I cried my brains out with her. My wife knows I‚Äôm being true, but there seems to be a smidge of doubt and a lack of understanding for how this impacted my life. 

Before I complicate things more, I‚Äôll remind you (should anyone read this) that I don‚Äôt want to draw attention to myself, I don‚Äôt want to say another thing to make people roll their eyes, and I can‚Äôt put myself in the position to questioned. It wouldn‚Äôt take a lot of work for certain people to figure out, at the least, which day care this happened at. The woman responsible also died 10-15 years ago. No justice will be served or needs to be served in my mind. Maybe I‚Äôm being stubborn, but I don‚Äôt think so. Lots of internal conflict‚Ä¶ 

I wish I could write the rest of my story, but I think I have to stop short. I‚Äôm not so innocent. I‚Äôm sure a certain ex-girlfriend just wrote #metoo while thinking of me. I don‚Äôt think what happened is textbook, but 90% consensual isn‚Äôt 100%. And for the first time, it sure as shit isn‚Äôt 100%. This 10% of wiggle room has haunted me for over 12 years. 15 minutes after it was over, which was soon, I was wailed on and yelled at. Before this, I thought everything was great (just embarrassing). I cried with her. I said a million ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äùs with absolute sincerity. It didn‚Äôt make things better. We kept dating for another year before college. She should‚Äôve just ended it then. I deserve to wear the letter ‚ÄòH‚Äô for hypocrite every day. A part of me wants to say it wasn‚Äôt that bad and I‚Äôm beating myself up over nothing. That‚Äôs what she would say, but it doesn‚Äôt make this right. 

I am now a feminist and I‚Äôm proud to see the best of my childhood friends writing #metoo with courage. I‚Äôm a coward, though, and I‚Äôm unworthy. Maybe there can be a widespread #imsorry as well, but still, I don‚Äôt think that would go over as well. 

I am really sorry that there was a time I couldn‚Äôt be true to myself and I took it out on others. If there is a grand purpose to writing this it is to encourage others to be stronger than I am and admit their faults before too much time passes. Actions have consequences.

&#x200B;

here is the article i am referencing [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/26/teen-boys-rated-their-female-classmates-based-looks-girls-fought-back/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/26/teen-boys-rated-their-female-classmates-based-looks-girls-fought-back/)

&#x200B;

for those of you that are too lazy to look basically two boys made a tier list of girls in the high school based off of their looks about a year ago. these boys had no intentions to share it with anyone but it ended up surfacing a month ago. girls felt scared and told the school principal. one of the boys is found and gets 1 day of in house suspension. the girls keep pushing though and a group of them go to talk to the principal again. this ends up causing a 2 hour meeting about sexual harassment. the boy who was found admitted he was wrong and now they are doing a bunch of metoo stuff in the school.

&#x200B;

A lot of this story may not be true and i will explain this. we are dealing with teenagers and there could be reasons on both sides to be slanting the story in their own favor. there are also things that just seem off to me. i feel this may be true but parts of the story are missing. im just going with my gut and this doesn't feel right.

&#x200B;

Since there is so much bullshit here im just gonna start at the beginning and go chronologically.

&#x200B;

the ""boys"" made this list where they ranked the girls in the school. this was originally only a list of 5 girls they considered average looking, but it escalated to more then that. they never had intentions to share this, they never state why. my guess is that ""they knew they would get in trouble, and they didn't want to cause drama"" thats the only reasonable conclusion i could come too.

&#x200B;

now a year later this list surfaces and spreads like jam on a countertop. the girls said some things to the principal  because they felt harassed. some of which i know was exaggerated BS. one claimed ""I was afraid to go to the bathroom because i was afraid i was being ranked"" This is just scumreading right here but that seems way too specific, and as someone who overthinks and is told im an overthinker. i know that was a lie. I theorize there could have been outside influence by adults with political agendas because this just feels off to me. this was a group of girls remember, not just one that had a problem. 

&#x200B;

only one of the boys is found and gets in house suspension for a day, remember that only one was found, this will be important later.

&#x200B;

The girls decide that they are still pissed off and what to push things further. this was officially when i decided that both sides are in the wrong. Justice was served, why are you still pushing this? i have a feeling this could of got pushed again because some girl had some previous beef with the boy and wanted him to get in more trouble. Honestly though, these girls are just witch hunting at this point, this boy did the time, yet they still wanna go after him like he is getting away with it. remember this is only a list ranking girls off their looks. that is one of the lower offenses in the category of sexual harassment. i feel that 1 day of in house is completely fair for what he did.

&#x200B;

my opinion is these girls are just witch hunting for no other reason but they wanna see him get in more trouble, and just by the weirdness of that part there i think that kind of supports my claim.

&#x200B;

the boy does not get any more discipline (thank god) and instead a 2 hour meeting is held with the girls and the boy who made the list. a lot of the things the article brought up that these girls said were things that were not really related to the incident at hand. this one girl said this guy in a truck catcalled her when she was walking at home, but i really don't see what this has to do with the boy here. dont get me wrong that truck driver is an ass but its just not relevant right now. the boy who made the list admitted he was wrong and should have been in trouble for it sooner. he also said he wanted to help fight toxic masculinity.

&#x200B;

BULLSHIT ALERT: remember that the article claimed that two boys made this list. if this boy actually cared about this he would have ratted the other boy out. this boy is just trying to save his own ass at this point.

&#x200B;

btw: i stopped taking this seriously after the toxic masculinity was brought up.

&#x200B;

now a couple of the girls and the boy are now trying to teach freshmen not to sexually harass people and are making a pop up museum about it. story ends

&#x200B;

just notice that this boy didn't get in trouble again and suddenly everyone was gone now that he couldnt get any more discipline. that just proves they wanted to witchhunt. 

&#x200B;

whew that was long. In the end i feel that both sides were in the wrong. The boy should have never made that list, and it just got out of hand with the witchhunting bull shit. 

&#x200B;

anyone wanna discuss this because i feel like this is one of those stories that you have to think about it before you truly understand it.

&#x200B;

this is my opinion, my theories about what could be missing from the story are not proven true. ",2,0,meToo,Devin_James0,1,2019-03-29 00:13:36
People wonder why I look like I hate my job...,2,b4fcmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b4fcmq/people_wonder_why_i_look_like_i_hate_my_job/,1,1553318167.0,"I started at this new job about three months ago. When I first started I was very reserved and shy around the people there. They all had a relationship and had been working together a long time. This guy in the kitchen would actually talk to me. I thought he was being friendly seeing as I was new and didn't know anyone. I had never had a guy friend before so maybe it was me that gave him misleading signs about my interest. He began to do things for me help me with a customer, help me stock up my area, etc. . Then one day he asked me to a movie. I said no thinking that he was joking and tried to explain why I didn't want to go. I just really didn't want to be around him when not at work. Then he asked me ""So, what we doing for Valentines?"" I thought it was weird this guy was 30 years old and I'm only 19 and he wants to do something with me. I was starting to feel uncomfortable by all these questions and responded that I already had plans. Maybe that was the wrong thing to say or I don't know. But that lead to more questions that I had to make up lies to. Days after that he would just stand at a distance from me and just stare at me. I was uncomfortable and I started to wear my jacket to cover up. One day while I was stocking up in the back of the store he came up to me and said ""So what about us? You messing with some dude called ______"" I thought we was a thing."" I got really scared and went back to the front to where everyone else was. I had left my phone by my station and when walking back saw it had moved. I opened my phone and saw that I had a notification from ______.  Someone that I had been friends with for a long time. I felt uncomfortable and violated and took the only route I thought possible. I became a stone faced bitch at work. While everyone else was laughing and joking, I would keep my distance from them and keep to myself. I would only smile to the customers when I had to but as soon as I turned my back my face was a blank face. I still try to make friends with people at work but as soon as he joins the conversation I leave. I have been acting like this for the last couple of months. I don't know what to do because I am sure that the manager won't believe me. He is friends with the managers and has worked there for two years while I'm still a newbie. Recently when I am talking to someone i turn around and he is standing behind me staring. I feel uncomfortable and hate when he works. I want to quit and find a new job but the managers are doing everything they can to keep me there. They are really nice people but I just don't know if they will believe what I am telling them.

I think i was sexually harassed by my classmate but im not sure,3,b36iok,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b36iok/i_think_i_was_sexually_harassed_by_my_classmate/,1,1553049299.0,"So my school has this thing where in home economics we have a practice interview and we have to dress up for it. I wore a skirt that was a little above knee length and a tight fitted sweater tucked in. It wasn't revealing at all but I noticed that just during first period there were 1 or 2 guys trying to look up my skirt. I checked earlier and made sure that nothing would show so thankfully no one saw anything (that I know of). I was bothered by the peeking but I could handle it because I'm used to this. I have a naturally larger hips really long legs compared to my torso and a skinny waist but barley anything up top so I see lots of guys staring and I've learned to ignore it. This however is the first time anyone had said anything to me to my face. I was walking down the hallway with my friend and we were talking. We decided to take the longer way to our next class because I really wanted to pass my crushes locker so I could have that glance at the back of his head just to know that he exists. That was my biggest mistake ever.  While I was approaching his locker two popular guys were about to pass us and I didn't really pay much attention to them. Right before we passed them I saw them looking at my legs and butt like I was a Gazzele and they were starving lions. I just ignored them until one of them said ""oh my god"" To the other while still in my line if vision. So I know they were still looking at me. By the way...  I'M THIRTEEN YEARS OLD!!!  It's not like I'm 17 and I can just beat the shit out of them. I'm a 4ft10 13yo introverted girl. I can't do anything. Ever sense then ive been beating my self up about not saying anything but I was just so shocked I kept on walking while my friend was just talking away not even noticing. I can't even tell a Cousuloer about it bc they can just say that they didn't do anything then tell everyone and my entire life will be over. It's not like I can just pretend it never happened because I have classes with them.  If I were to call them out now they prolly wouldn't even remember. Ive only told my closest friend and she's been asking me how I'm holding up multiple times a day bc this has really impacted my mental health and I can't tell my mom because she will go in and bitch slap them and then my social life will be flushed down the toilet. One time I got dress coded because my bra strap was showing and my mom went into school and screamed at the teacher until she apologized so she's insane.  I just don't know what to do because I honestly just want to get over it and not have anyone know so please help me bc I would really appreciate it",3,0,meToo,DonutChino,1,2019-03-20 05:34:59
My Fault? Help.,2,azmupb,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/azmupb/my_fault_help/,0,1552265649.0,"I am 18 right now. But at the time I was 17. It was summer 2018. I had a best friend who lived in a city 4 hours away. He used to live in the same town I did and that was how I knew him. 

We had been texting pretty well everyday. He did send flirty text every once in a while, but I tried to shut him down nicely without being rude. I am very shy and awkward so I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings. And he planned a trip to my town so we could hang out. We planned to drink and watch movies and just hangout. We were taking big shots and lots of shots. We were down in my living room and we were just talking and listening to music I think then he hugged me. I honestly thought it was a friendly hug so I hugged back. He just simply says ‚ÄúI missed you‚Äù and to that I said I missed you too. Then things start to get blurry and I started to feel sick. 

I told him we were going to go upstairs to the kitchen to get some water. We did so I drank the water and still felt dizzy and sick. That was when he kissed me the first time. I pushed him away and said I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea. And that was one of my first mistakes. I didn‚Äôt say straight up no. He apologized and I said it was fine because that‚Äôs what everyone says when someone apologizes. Mistake number 2 I shouldn‚Äôt have said it was fine because he thought it was ok to do it again. He said we should take another shot and then go out for a smoke and he wanted to smoke a joint. We did our shots and went outside where we started smoking. I didn‚Äôt smoke any of the weed because I was really drunk and i knew I would have puked if I did. That was when he kissed me for the sending time. I turned my face away and wouldn‚Äôt look at him. This is where it gets really fuzzy I‚Äôm not really sure what happened next but he kept kissing me and I kept pulling away. After finishing our smokes we went inside and we‚Äôre about to go to sleep. I was supposed to sleep in a different bed but all the blankets and sheets were in the washing machine still wet. I felt so sick and could barley walk up the stairs so mistake number 3. I slept in the same bed as him. 

This is the part where i only remember flashes of. I remember being under him and he was inside me, during that flash there is one sound. It sounded like a little metal bell. 

The next morning I wake up with no pants on and him right behind me ‚Äúspooning‚Äù me and only had boxers on. I got up right away feeling dirty. I got him up and washed the bedding and went for a shower that lasted about 40 mins of me scrubbing at my skin. I cried. I went to my boyfriends right after. 


That night I was supposed to go to my other friends party at her farm with him. I told him I felt sick and I wasn‚Äôt going. So I messaged my friend pretending to be my rapist saying that I was puking and sick and that we wouldn‚Äôt be going. 


A couple days later my friend who was throwing the party matched with my rapist on tinder. I just said good for them. And hoped nothing would come of it. Something did come of it they started going out and I kept it a secret from everybody no one but me knew. I started to hang out with both of them regularly. I thought it was all my fault I should have said no. I treated him like a normal person not someone who raped me and hurt me and changed my life forever. 

He tried to touch me a couple other times while we were drunk but never got that far, and yes they were together at the time. 

I kept it my secret for 6 months when I finally I had enough of holding it in. I told my boyfriend. Then my mom. Then I confronted him. He denied all of it and said I wanted it and said I was giving him signals all night long. And that I never said no. I never said no, I was too drunk to say yes either. And he knew that. 

My other friend, the girl who he was dating took his side and doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rape because of how I treated him. Like a person I didn‚Äôt treat him like the monster he was. That‚Äôs just who I am I treated him how I wanted to be treated and in the end it screwed me over. She is no longer my friend or I‚Äôm my life and neither is he. I quit drinking because of it and as soon as I feel myself getting drunk I feel anxious and just gross. 

I sat on the bed it happened the other day and heard the bell sound. It was the broken metal head board rattling. I just cried because of that noise. Or sometimes I will smell deodorant that smelt like him that night and break Down. I have nightmares of him finding me and convincing everyone I love it was my fault. I honestly don‚Äôt know if it was my fault. I want to believe it wasn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs so hard. Help.

Cavalleria Rusticana goes even darker.,2,aui8bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/aui8bz/cavalleria_rusticana_goes_even_darker/,0,1551077691.0,"I am an opera singer. I was cast in Cavalleria Rusticana as Turiddu (the tenor). For those of you not familiar, here is a scene of it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzsmbnr2o0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzsmbnr2o0w). It was the scene I was assaulted in. At about the 20 second mark *it* happened. The Santuzza (the soprano) was someone who I had some history with.

Some backstory. I worked in a university office for some time, and the attacker (who I shall call Alyssa), got me the job, as she had seniority in her job and was considerably older than me, and we were great friends at the time. We did the terribly boring work and bitched, and all was fine for a while, until something  came out of her mouth that was a little bit weird- '...if you were 10-15 years older I'd bone you.' (paraphrase). I thought... um ok. It was weird for someone who was, supposedly, such a loud feminist to say this. She continued to say these things repeatedly throughout my time there.

We then had dinner out one night after work, as the university was near a sort of 'Little Italy' and we had pizza and pasta. I explained to her that I felt uncomfortable with her saying these things, as a) she was my boss so it was actually formal harassment, b) I was in a relationship at the time and c) I just plain don't consent to that. The comments stopped for a while. Then she stopped talking to me altogether, as my gf at the time (who had experienced worse before) implicitly made me aware of red flags. Of course Alyssa blamed the relationship I was in.

Fast forward to the opera. The company had trouble finding an available Santuzza. When making my way to the first rehearsal I wondered who it was going to be. I ran through some names in my head but they were all busy with other show. Then almost immediately before walking through the doors, I thought- no. Ugh please don't let it be Alyssa. Who was sitting there? Alyssa.

So I tried to behave professionally, because maybe she had cleaned up her act. Anyway, we had to find separate  rehearsal time as we didn't have enough time together in the rehearsal space to rehearse enough. Here's where it gets a bit... funky. At a point in  the show, the director had made a dramatic choice (that was silly, but hey) to have us kiss on stage. I told her, explicitly, that I was not comfortable doing that and if we could find some way around it, like kiss slightly to the side of the mouth, or a 'stage kiss', which is essentially the same thing. She kept saying 'Oh, sure, but if we miss, it's ok. We'll just do a real one.' I re-iterated...'No, Alyssa, I do not want to. We must try to do a stage kiss.' This same back and forth continued for approximately 5 minutes. I think it was the 'try' that gave her an out. We rehearsed  it in formal rehearsal time, and stage kissing her made me wince every time, but I could deal with it I guess.When we went on stage, I thought, OK, I have to do this only one more time, then I never have to see her again. It got to the stage kiss moment... and as I went for the fake one, she pulled my head towards her and properly kissed me. No one could say anything, because it just looked like part of the show. The scene came to an end, (tbh most of it is a blur except for that), and I briskly walked off stage, upstairs to my dressing room and cried. The baritone singing that performance asked if I was OK. I wasn't really OK to share what just happened. Normally, with a sop/mezzo here I would de-brief, and hug during the applause. I chose not to speak to her, alas I still had to hold her hand for an applause.

Fast forward a few years, I see her around the place, and have to share stages with her. I had to recently. I have heard she has done this to other people as well. At least I'm not alone, but I think it's an unwritten rule that people don't talk about how terrible she is. Maybe someone needs to. Does she even know? Does it make it worse when you do something  like that as default behaviour or when it's knowingly terrible?

MeToo and Dating,2,au4d7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/au4d7r/metoo_and_dating/,2,1550982783.0,Something has been on my mind a lot lately. Especially as there has been so much coverage in the media with the Jussie Smollett case or even more to apt the Kavanaugh situation for example. It seems like such a debated issue these days whether we should start from a place of believing victims or this sort of ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù mantra. Which should apply to criminal court proceedings of course but not for showing empathy to human beings who are expressing trauma. This point seems to be lost on a lot of people blinded by their politics. I‚Äôm really looking for opinions from people who have gone through putting their own traumas out there when dating. I‚Äôve talked to friends about it and have opinions myself. My personal feelings are that now more than ever it seems politics have made it so hard for heterosexual men to show any compassion. It seems like they are all so busy being on the defensive that they don‚Äôt have any ability to be understanding. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs a lonely feeling to think I will never meet someone who can take abuse seriously and treat me with the love and respect I deserve. As someone who has allowed myself to be damaged by settling for less I would never do so again. I guess I‚Äôve sort of made my peace with the fact that this is the landscape now. It‚Äôs just very disheartening. I was wondering if anybody out there has a different experience?,2,0,meToo,redditcat91,1,2019-02-24 07:33:03

Worst day of my life,2,at8igp,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/at8igp/worst_day_of_my_life/,6,1550783463.0,"This was May of 2018. I had been 18 not 5 months. I was in college. Excelling in my classes as a A+ kid and everyone was jealous because I hadn‚Äôt even graduated from high school yet and I had my whole life planned. But plans can change. And they do. Apparently the higher forces of the planet didn‚Äôt like what I had planned. This is how it started. His eyes. His smile. He was 28. He was a genius. I needed help in math. He was a tutor. And a damn good one. I‚Äôd been getting tutored by free tutors at the college for 3 terms by that time. And none of them made me understand the problems and actually be able to solve it myself, more then he did. He was brilliant. And. Into me. I thought it was cute. Like how every freshman girl dreams of dating a senior. Especially a smart one who knows what he‚Äôs doing. Third time with him as my tutor and he wanted my number. Him and one of his friends talked about a hiking trip while he was tutoring me. He asked if I was interested in the wilderness because they want to start a club. I said yes. They both talked about 20+ people coming on a hiking trip. He asked if I wanted to go. I said idk what I got coming up this weekend, so he wanted my number so I can tell him if I can go or not. I thought. Sure. Why not. I went home and about 3 hours later that night. I got a text from him. We hit it off. Texted back and fourth the whole time. Days this went on. He was charming. He had a way with words. And he got me. Even though my life at that point was practically perfect, he saw my depression. He saw through the fake smile. We talked about real life shit. We would talk about the possibility of parallel universes or if someone went to the future and saw themselves, if there will then be a never ending time paradox and so on. We nerded out. We talked about depression. Anxiety. Ddlg. He was a dom. The only person I ever met who was like me that way irl. If I didn‚Äôt want to talk he‚Äôd talk some other random thing to make me laugh. I never opened up to someone so fucking fast. It was weird. It was great. He got me. I could be real with him. He knew when I was off and he helped me get better. I couldn‚Äôt go on the hike that Saturday. I had work. The next Saturday I could though. I was off work. And my friend was going to unknowingly cover for me because she wanted me to go to an event I told her I couldn‚Äôt go to but I told my mother I would go to. After all. What mother would allow her daughter to go on a hike to god knows where with someone she‚Äôs known 2 weeks and a lot of other people she never met. That was my first mistake. I let my guard down too fast. But hey. I was innocent. It‚Äôs a small town I thought. I was trying to logically tell myself it was ok. Because I was nervous. And I‚Äôve never been a people person. It‚Äôs a small town. Like 30 thousand people. I don‚Äôt have to worry about a bunch of college kids. Jon will protect me if something goes wrong. He knows I didn‚Äôt like drinking and drunks. He knows I wouldn‚Äôt do drugs. And I told him if anything happens that I don‚Äôt like I will leave. Dead serious. I had my life planned out. I wasn‚Äôt going to let a bunch of drunk college people ruin it. I didn‚Äôt know there wasn‚Äôt going to be anyone but me and him. I didn‚Äôt know I walked into his perfect little plan. There was this trail. A link river trail. The river literally links two lakes together, with a damn at the base of the northern one so the one by the town won‚Äôt flood. It had a gravel hiking trail. We were taking that. But no. We weren‚Äôt. He took me up a path I didn‚Äôt know existed. On the other side of the river. On a mountain. In the wind. By a damn. Where no one sees you. Or can hear you... I pull up and he‚Äôs there. Just him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs everyone‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúI gave you the wrong time. I told you 30 minutes late on accident. They all are hiking. I stayed behind for you. We‚Äôll catch up to them‚Äù. His confident smile and gleaming eyes told me it was ok. Told me to trust him. And I did. Mistake number...what are we on now...10? He went ahead of me by about two steps. We walked and talked about random shit again. The time flew. I looked down at my phone and almost an hour we have been hiking. I asked ‚Äúwhy haven‚Äôt we coughs up to them yet?‚Äù He stopped. Looked at me. Smiled. And pointed to the hill we were halfway up. The 4th hill we hiked so far. And the biggest one. With the ghostly downtown on one side. And a rocky cliff with a roaring damn on the other. No warning signs there right? Nope. Stupid stupid stupid me. He pointed to the hill and said ‚ÄúI told them that‚Äôs the meeting point. That‚Äôs where we stop and go back. They are waiting there.‚Äù Ok. Fine. One more hill. I can do it. This one was more rocky. I slipped. He took my hand. My heart swooned. I got my footing but he didn‚Äôt let go. I secretly didn‚Äôt want him to. ‚ÄúThis part is rocky. Don‚Äôt want you slipping again. Just hold onto me. I‚Äôll keep you safe‚Äù. My hero. Right? ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù I could tell my face was as red as a tomato. But his smile melted away my worries. Hand in hand we climbed the rest of thay hill. Until we were at the top. That‚Äôs when I realized my mistake. There was no one. Not even signs of people. The whole hills we climbed, besides the rocky part, were all wheat filled. Dry wheat. I never saw signs of 20 people walking through. I never heard laughs or screams of loud college kids having fun where no law officer can see them. I never saw cars but just his and I... I asked where they were. He said it‚Äôs just him and I. And I realized his grip on my hand hurt. He pulled his hand away and shoved me. I screamed. He pounced on me. Knees on my legs, hands pinning my struggling hands above my head. My screaming. He didn‚Äôt stop me from screaming. That‚Äôs how I knew no one would hear. He didn‚Äôt bother to hide my screaming. It showed me how hopeless I was. After a few seconds I stopped screaming. I‚Äôd just hiked 3 hills and didn‚Äôt drink water. My mouth was dry. I was already weak. And I gave up. I knew what I got myself into. And I knew there was no one to blame but me. He eventually let go of my hands and moved off me. Just to shove me harder back into the dry hard dirt and then yank my jeans off like they were on fire. Then he shoves my legs up to my chest as hard as he could. I could almost hear my muscles screaming no more, feeling like they would rip off. I was a virgin. A fool. A fool encaptured by a smile. My hand were where he still pinned them Above my head. So I grabbed my hair and pulled as hard as I could without being noticed. I thought maybe the pain of that would make me forget the way he‚Äôs ruining me. I closed my eyes because the smile on his face, like I‚Äôm some trophy he worked hard for and deserved. I tried to pretend it was me with my unknown husband on our honeymoon. But then I got disgusted with myself for trying to find a way to enjoy this awful thing. I felt like throwing up with every thrust of his. He said he wouldn‚Äôt stop until I would cum for him. 3 times. He said he always makes his sex partners cum three times before he stops. But I have never came. I didn‚Äôt know how. So I faked it. As best as I could. I had to space them out so he would believe them. I had to pretend it left me pleased and exhausted. It went on for almost an hour until 4 fake cums later and 3 or so times of him cumming in me, he got up. Put on his jeans. When I realized he was done I was numb. I looked at him. And he growled down at me ‚ÄúI have a girlfriend and two roommates that will say I was home at this time if you ever try to tell anyone on me.‚Äù He left. As soon as I felt he was out of earshot. I started sobbing. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I didn‚Äôt know who to tell. I was so alone. 99% of me was tempted to just jump off that cliff. But I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to let one bad thing make me run from life. About an hour later I got up. Got dressed. And walked to my car. Every now and again I‚Äôd fall and just start crying again. I finally got to my car and I texted my mom to ask if she was home. She wasn‚Äôt. And dad was at a hospital appointment. So I went home. Showered. I wanted his filth off of me. Out of me. I washed myself maybe 5 times. I wanted his touch and everything off me. I wanted to wash the past 3 hours off of my life. I deleted him on my phone. And blocked him. Not realizing I deleted the proof of him texting me the meeting place and time. I went over to my friends house. Painted on a fake smile. An hour or so later she finally asked what‚Äôs been wrong and I started bawling and I told her everything. She told me to tell my parents. I did. They didn‚Äôt believe me. See they recently found out I was on KIK in ddlg groups and I was ‚Äúsexting‚Äù my ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù so when I told them about this they didn‚Äôt believe it and said even if it didn‚Äôt happen I probably asked for it and loved it. A week lateen mt best friend made me take a pregnancy test. I wasnt pregnant. Thank god. So. Why did I write this hour long story? A few reasons. To raise awareness. Just because he‚Äôs awesome and cute and you can pour your heart and soul out, doesn‚Äôt mean you can throw caution in the wind. To tell it and get it out and over with so I can say I told my story. A few people heard, maybe a few relate, or will take caution with there Prince Charming. But the main reason I wrote this. 3 weeks ago I moved in with my daddy. And today he asked if I could not be raped. But never met him. Would I? I said idk. And I didn‚Äôt know. But now I do. It was then WORST day of my life. Hell. It was the worst 6 months. Following that I stopped showing up to school and failed my classes, stopped haning out with friends, and burried myna problems into working and sleeping. And it got worse before it got better. My dog I had for 12 years died in July. I left home to probably never see or hear my family again. I lost a lot of ‚Äúgood‚Äù friends. Including the one who bought me birth control and told me no matter what she would be there and always be someone I can turn to. But what did I gain? Let me tell you about the best day of my life. It‚Äôs when i met my daddy. John. With an H. Not to be mistaken with the Jon who took me hiking. And let me tell you another story. The one in the future. Where me and a John get married. Have kids. Have a life together for the next 20+ years. Yes. Id be raped again if I had to repeat it. Because it‚Äôs May have affected me for 6+ months. But That. For the rest of forever and always with John? Worth it.

I appreciated his comments on the accusations and hoped there would be some follow up to clear the air and possibly give him a chance to clear his name (I admit it, I like James Franco onscreen) but nothing has come of it yet. Instead he has been working with Henry Hopper on multiple film projects and has been seen hanging out nights with him. Henry Hopper raped a 15 year old girl. He admitted it and admitted it was premeditated as part of the settlement. I now have no choice but to believe the allegations against Franco as I lived in Venice for a few years and Henry is an open secret there as are his friends. Just venting I guess. I'm frustrated by the lack of attention on their collaboration.

So long story short, I am directing a movie and a person I had in mind for a part has suddenly be revealed to me as someone who very credibly committed a sexual assault about five years ago. I believe the girl making the claims, but I also don't know her at all, although another close friend and crew member who told me about it does, and I trust him. But I also know the guy in question pretty well and have been okay acquantices for a good while and have a lot of mutual friends, although I have no seen him in at least 5-6 years. I hate to just jump to a conclusion but the story is kinda of hard to ignore. Anyway, I've decided I'm going to pass on him in the role because I just do not need the drama right now and certainly don't want to be the director who knowingly hired a potential sexual predator. My question is, do I flat out tell him why I'm passing on the part? Do I give him the benefit of the doubt and let him explain? Or should I just pass and move on?

I know this situation will spark heated debate on both sides, but try to keep then personal attacks at Bay as much as you can.

.*..El fue irrespetuoso y me hizo sentir muy inc√≥modo. √âl esper√≥ hasta que est√°bamos solos, cuando yo no pod√≠a escapar, y √©l me toc√≥ sexualmente de maneras que no quer√≠a, aunque le dije que no varias veces. Creo que es importante que sepas esto. Por favor, comparten esa carta con √©l. Es importante para mi que √©l lo reciba.*

Nosotros mujeres de todo el mundo somos personas. Somos mam√°s, t√≠as, abuelas, y hijas. Hijas como la tuya. Y mucho m√°s. Tenemos nuestras propias vidas. Vidas llenas, incluso sin novios, esposos, y hombres como ti. No somos objetos para ti o tu satisfacci√≥n o entretenimiento.

La definici√≥n de ""no"" se significa claramente: no. La primera vez. No es necesario asegurarse una segunda vez. o la tercera vez. O veintid√≥s veces m√°s. Ignorando ""no"" la primera vez ejemplifica el car√°cter de un sinverg√ºenza. ""No"" se significa claramente que ""no"" la primera vez, punto y final. 

El cuerpo es la catedral de una persona. El templo de historia, memorias, dificultades, y esperanzas por el futuro de una persona real. Esos lugares sagrados debe ser tratados con el mayor respeto. ¬øHay espacio para vandalismo en una catedral, templo, o en un para√≠so? Un solo toque sin consentimiento, consentimiento entusiasta, es los mismo que vandalismo. Un templo, como nuestros cuerpos, merece respeto. 

La palabra ""respeto"" no es solo una frase or una consigna. Se muestra respeto a otra persona a trav√©s de la combinaci√≥n de palabras y acciones. No es suficiente usar palabras. El respeto es constante y honesto. Se practica cuando solo y con otras personas. Se muestra respeto con tus manos, tus pensamientos, y tu coraz√≥n. Dar respeto es un tipo de activismo y una responsabilidad de todas personas.  Es una responsabilidad para el mundo, tu comunidad, tu familia, y ti mismo. 

El concepto de respeto es una cosa dif√≠cil para muchas personas. Puede ser dif√≠cil de entender el significado de respeto si una persona no reciban suficiente respeto y amor incondicional en su propia vida.  Sin una comprensi√≥n profunda del amor propio, puede ser m√°s dif√≠cil entender c√≥mo dar respeto. No obstante, para todas las personas, aprender dar respeto, respeto para todas las personas, es posible. 

Nuestros corazones son el hogar del respeto. Nuestros corazones son una caja de sangre con bastante espacio para el amor por todas personas en todo el mundo. Espero que poco a poco encuentres el amor propio y consecuentemente amor por otras personas tambi√©n. Solo entonces podr√°s ver el verdad: amor y respeto para otras personas realmente es amor y respeto para ti mismo. 

Solo con esa sabidur√≠a podr√°s vivir una vida real. Una vida libre.

 *...He was disrespectful and made me feel very uncomfortable. He waited until we were alone, when I could not escape, and he touched me sexually in ways I did not want, even though I told him not several times. I think it's important that you know this. Please, share this letter with him. It is important to me that he receives it.*  

We women from all over the world, we are people. We are moms, aunts, grandmothers, and daughters. Daughters like yours. And much more. We have our own lives. Full lives, even without boyfriends, husbands, and men like you. We are not objects for you or your satisfaction or entertainment. 

The definition of ""no"" is clearly meant: no. The first time. It is not necessary to ensure a second time. or the third time. Or twenty-two times more. Ignoring ""no"" the first time exemplifies the character of a scoundrel. ""No"" clearly means ""no"" the first time, period. 

The body is the cathedral of a person. The temple of the history, memories, difficulties, and hopes for the future of a real person. These sacred places should be treated with the greatest respect. Is there room for vandalism in a cathedral, temple, or in paradise? One touch without consent, enthusiastic consent, is the same as vandalism. A temple, like our bodies, deserves respect. 

The word ""respect"" is not just a phrase or a slogan. Respect is shown to another person through the combination of words and actions. It is not enough to use words. Respect is constant and honest. It is practiced when alone and with other people.  Respect is shown with your hands, your thoughts, and your heart. Giving respect is a kind of activism and responsibility of all people. It is a responsibility for the world, your community, your family, and yourself. 

The concept of respect is a difficult thing for many people. It can be difficult to understand the meaning of respect if a person does not receive enough respect and unconditional love in their own life. Without a deep understanding of self-love, it can be harder to understand how to give respect. However, for all people, learning to give respect, respect for all people, is possible. 

Our hearts are the home of respect. Our hearts are a box of blood with plenty of space for love for all people around the world. I hope that little by little you will find self-love and consequently love for other people as well. Only then can you see the truth: love and respect for other people is really love and respect for yourself. 

Only with that wisdom can you live a real life. A free life. ",2,0,meToo,jyuerosemei,1,2018-12-27 00:16:08

I don't know how to feel about this,2,9q3p0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9q3p0k/i_dont_know_how_to_feel_about_this/,10,1540130314.0,"Ok so recently I started processing a hookup that happened over a year ago, and I realized I had repressed some negative feelings about it. I'm curious what an impartial observer would make of it. 

So there's this guy I was acquainted with because he was the friend of a friend, so I saw him every year at her b-day and not much in between. I've known him for years and always thought he was cute and funny, but we'd never had a 1-1 conversation. 

Last year on her b-day we were out to a club, and he was there. I was already pleasantly buzzed and that's usually my cue to stop drinking, but I was surprised when he came up to me and said ""let's get drinks"". I decided to go with it, and went with him at the bar, where he insisted to buy me a shot or 2 (don't remember). Then we got cocktails and went back to the group. We danced together and then  we went outside to get some air, and he surprised me by kissing me. 

In all the years I've known him he's never shown any interest in me, so I knew he was only doing it now because he was trying to hook up. The kiss was a letdown, after fancying him for so long, there was no spark. However, I was already a bit more than buzzed and enjoying the attention, so I went with it and we kissed some more. He kept telling me that I was going home with him tonight, and I kept laughing it off, because I never leave clubs with guys, that's just not my thing. Hooking up with someone for the first time is always a sober affair, and usually preceded by at least some conversation. So I didn't think much of it.

At some point our friends came out to tell us they wanted to leave to go to an after-party at my friend's house, but my drink and jacket were still inside, so he told them to leave without us. I'm not used to having to make decisions when my thinking is impaired by alcohol, so I was out of my depth by this point. I kept trying to clear my head and keep my wits about me. But I didn't think much about remaining alone with him. After all, he wasn't a stranger. I'd just go grab my jacket and then we'd both go to my friend's house. 

So that's what I did. I got into a cab and gave the cabbie my friend's address. He got in a minute after, and asked me where we were going. I said ""my friend's house, as we discussed"". And he just said ""no"" and gave the cabbie his own address. I was just... speechless. I didn't know how to react. Inside I was like ""what do you mean no?"" I couldn't process the fact that someone had just completely disregarded my express wishes and acted like my opinion on the matter was invalid. It felt like I was talking into a void. It also felt a bit weird that the cabbie just went with it, like it was obvious that his word trumped mine. But I didn't say anything. I was still trying to process the situation. All I knew was that if I were sober I wouldn't be hooking up with him, because I knew he was only hitting on me because I was there and available, and that didn't sit right with me. 

We get to his building, and I say fine, you brought me here, but I'm going to my friend's. He proceeded to insist I come up. It was late at night, I was a bit drunk and in an unfamiliar neighborhood.. so I finally said ""ok, I'll come up but we're not having sex"". 

Of course, once we were up in his room he started groping me, and I guess... after having my objections ignored over and over, I just accepted that the easiest way out would be through. In hindsight, that's definitely not a good enough reason to have sex with someone.
One thing I was adamant about was that we use a condom. He tried to argue, but I wasn't going to budge. I wasn't on any birth control and had no idea about his sexual history, so I wasn't about to take any stupid risks. So he reluctantly got a condom. But afterwards I realized he had taken it off without me knowing. He told me it had ""slipped"". In that moment I did feel violated and used. I had a right to protect myself, and he took that away from me like it was nothing. 

In the morning he started making plans about getting together again, and the worst part is that I went through with it. I think I was trying to convince myself that everything had been consensual, so if I did it again, this time while sober, it would mean make it ok, right? 
So we hooked up again a few days later, and after that I never saw him again. He called me a few times but I always told him I was busy. I was still in denial about not being ok with what happened, so I couldn't even pinpoint a reason why I didn't want to see him again. 

To this day he's the one feeling offended that I ghosted him, as I've noticed from his frosty hellos the couple times I bumped into him since. And I'm sure from his perspective he did nothing wrong, which is the most concerning part of all of this. I don't think he's a bad person, or that he saw himself as a predator when he got me drunk, separated me from my friends and disregarded all my objections. I know he was also drunk, probably even more so than me. I've tried to think if this is enough to excuse his behavior, but I just don't know. He probably even feels like it's no big deal to take a condom off without telling your partner, which in my eyes is completely despicable. 

However, I'd feel pretty weird telling him all of this a year later, when I finally made my peace about my own feelings about it. But maybe that's why some men never learn that this behavior is not ok, because no one calls them out on it. 

On my part, I know nothing would have happened if I didn't continue drinking against my better judgment. But I also know my alarm bells never went off because he wasn't a stranger, I knew and trusted him. If a stranger had tried to get the cab to take us to his place I'd have raised hell, drunk or not.

‚ÄúRepressed‚Äù does not equal ‚Äúmade up‚Äù,2,9ok9ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9ok9ro/repressed_does_not_equal_made_up/,0,1539663834.0,"I‚Äôm a little late to the Kavanaugh party. After all, our newest Justice has been confirmed and is currently sitting on the highest court of the land. At the same time, I find myself struggling with my own repressed memories and empathizing with Dr. Blasey-Ford.

There is an ongoing debate in psychological studies about the trustworthiness of recovered memories. From my own experience and the extrinsic evidence surrounding it, I believe such memories can be legitimate. I have no empirical data to opine on whether such experiences are the majority; I only have my own experience on which to base my opinion.

The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh brought up a flood of feelings for me. One feeling in particular stood out: desperation. Desperation for a feeling of acceptance and validation from those closest to me. And yet, that desperation remained raw and unresolved.

My own mother, the person I consider my fiercest ally, still questions my account of a sexual assault that took place when I was young. I was nine and victimized by the father of a friend I was visiting. I repressed the memory and did not allow it to surface until I was nineteen. And even though my mother was with me for every step after that fateful visit‚Äîfrom picking me up that day in tears and hearing me repeat, ‚ÄúI never want to go back there,‚Äù as we sped away in her Volvo, a trail of dust behind us; as we went to the doctor for my first ‚Äúfemale‚Äù evaluation soon after and learned that my hymen was somehow inextricably broken; and as I falsely accused a boy at school of touching me inappropriately‚Äîshe still thinks that I conjured the memories that came washing over me a decade after the event. 

Psychologists have since told me that I was too young at nine to process the trauma, and that I repressed it until I was old enough to deal with it. On top of it all, the perpetrator told me that if I told anyone what he had done, he would kill my whole family. In other words, I believed that he would destroy everything and everyone that I loved. Enough for a nine-year-old to stay silent and pretend nothing had ever happened.

I was on the phone with my boyfriend at the time I recovered the event at nineteen. I don‚Äôt remember what he said to me, but I remember feeling as if memories were suddenly unlocked and began appearing before me like scenes in a slide show. I fell to the floor in tears as they washed over me. The bedroom with the yellow floral bedspread. Wood paneling on the walls. The blinds over the window above the bed. The man with no face over me (I still can‚Äôt bring myself to see his face). The feeling of fingers inside me. My friend on the couch as I emerged from the bedroom, peering up at me under her bangs in a knowing way. Demanding in the kitchen to call my mother. Waiting desperately by the screen door for her car to appear up the dirt trail. Bolting from the trailer. Sobbing on the way home.

As we discussed Kavanaugh, Mom questioned Christine Blasey-Ford‚Äôs recovery of repressed memories. I responded by noting, ‚ÄúI know you have issues with repressed memories, given how you responded to what I told you.‚Äù She did not deny this or otherwise answer me except to nod, causing my heart to sink. Even now, almost twenty years after I told her what happened, almost twenty years after facing the evidence, she would still rather side with the fiction that nothing happened to me than to accept that she could not keep me safe that day and to validate my feelings and experience. In light of the extraneous evidence surrounding the events of that day‚Äîevidence that my mother acknowledges and yet seemingly dismisses‚Äîmy therapists have all agreed that my recovered memories are authentic. But Mom can‚Äôt bring herself to this conclusion. I suppose this is one more consequence of that fateful day that I will have to bear forever.

I am now the mother of nine-year-old twins. I pray that I can keep them safe, but I realize there are inevitably moments during which they are in the hands of strangers, and I must pray that they remain unharmed. I also pray that in the event my children are ever victimized, my eyes and ears are open then. As a last resort, if my eyes and ears fail me, I pray that my mind is open to reality.

And I still, and always will, love my Mama.",2,0,meToo,NoleLadyFL09,1,2018-10-16 07:23:54
Was this assault?,2,9ojek4,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9ojek4/was_this_assault/,8,1539656503.0,"I went to a new gynecologist last year for a routine. 32 at the time. She was an older woman, mid-late 60s. There were a few things that were off during my exam, different from the past 17 years of gyno exams in my life. 

There was no nurse present for any of it. 
The doctor talked without stopping, about random topics as if we were friends shooting the breeze- the entirety of my exam. No questions regarding my health. 

And lastly, with zero warning at all; she inserted two fingers into my rectum. Mid sentence while she was telling some mundane story. She kept talking as she felt around. After she removed her fingers she cracked a joke and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to tell people cuz they get all nervous‚Äù.  She then told me to get dressed and all felt/looked normal. 

My question- is this common? Has anyone ever been given a surprise a rectal exam during a pap? In 17 years, I never had a doctor give me a rectal exam. I knew after a certain age i would be necessary but I assumed the Dr would inform me that it was on the agenda. 

It felt wrong and totally violating. I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty for feeling that way because she was a nice old lady. A seasoned medical doctor. Am I making too big a deal of this in my mind? My annual is due and honestly I‚Äôm dreading going to any gynecologist after this experience. Thanks for reading. Sorry if it doesn‚Äôt even belong in this subreddit.

As two 60+ men walked back inside the brewery one man stopped and calls ahead to his friend ‚ÄúI might be awhile I‚Äôm going to sit in the sun on this girls lap.‚Äù

This was the first interaction between this older guy and woman. She awkwardly laughed it off as did a couple of her friends that were with her and the guy ended up walking inside soon after. 

I realized that not even this behavior is okay. Yet as women often we laugh it off when men make these ‚Äújokes‚Äù to us because we don‚Äôt know what to say and feel uncomfortable. This would have been the perfect moment - with the several people as witness for someone to say ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs not okay for you to talk to her that way.‚Äù I suppose it could have been me who said that and I missed my chance.

THE LIST,2,9kzb1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9kzb1j/the_list/,6,1538555387.0,"Throwaway account. This is my personal list I keep in the memo app on my phone. The list that I add to every time something particularly bad happens. The list that won‚Äôt stop growing no matter how nice I am, how professional I am, how conservative I am.......the list does not stop.

Tl:dr a list of shit that has happened that still haunts me. Everyday stuff most women probably deal with. Just had to tell someone....


I am 10 years old. An idiot classmate from elementary school, Julian, sneers at me about how I have ""nice balls"" when riding bikes around my neighborhood, I go home upset and ask my parents what ""balls"" are. I thought he meant my butt....

I am in middle school, 6th grade, on a music field trip to New York city. A man on the street with a python around his neck keeps asking my girlfriends and I if we want to come with him to ""touch his snake"". The music teacher has to come over to get him to leave us alone.

6th grade through 8th. This was the creepy tech ed teacher who wasn‚Äôt the same after a stroke and liked looking down girls‚Äô shirts. I never took tech ed for that reason but girls who did wore sweatshirts to his class in the summertime. I saw him kneeling on a folding table looking straight down girls‚Äô dresses as they walked by in a line for graduation. I heard plenty of stories from the girls who took his class as well.

8th grade. Mr. G, the creepy gym teacher in his 50s who placed his hand much too low on my waist when coaching me to be quarterback for flag football for one class. He walked in on us changing in the locker room and did not leave until the female coach started screaming he needed to get out, it happened twice while I was there.

9th grade. The new student who was seated next to me kept dropping things on the floor under my chair during AP Lang and kept brushing under my thigh when he was ""just reaching for his pencil"". I moved my chair as far away as I could during those classes or offered to keep picking things up for him.

9th grade walking out from my violin lesson at a gated music conservatory to my parents‚Äô car across the street. A homeless man asked me to lift up my skirt for him. I think I was 15.

10th grade. Paddy ran at girls while we were sitting in line at gym class and would jump over our heads and do splits. Then he would grab rope and pretend it was a penis as he waved it around at us. He got too competitive at volleyball. He hit me and pushed me into the metal net pole after I scored on him. I hit my head. He did not apologize and the gym teacher only yelled his name sternly. My quiet girlfriend cussed him out right there, I love her for that. He hit me so hard his handprint was still on my arm after class. His (girl) friends saw the handprint in the locker room and vowed not to be friends with him anymore.

11th grade. Scrawny kid in my gym class had anger issues and used to go to an anger management middle school. He was mad at my large, muscular male friend  but couldn‚Äôt fight him so he took it out on me. He chased us around the school while throwing objects at my butt like metal door stops and whipped me with wire cords as we tried to get away during our indoor walking class (it was raining out). The gym teacher chased after him yelling for him to go to the principal‚Äôs office. He was suspended for a week and had to give me an apology. I accepted because I honestly thought if anyone would shoot up the school it would be him and I didn‚Äôt want to be on his bad side. I am still scared of him and it‚Äôs been 7 years.

Freshman year of college. I am 18. The guy from intramural volleyball group said he would organize a get together for all of us. Only he shows up alone to my dorm for the halloween event (games on each floor in common rooms). I didn‚Äôt find out until after that he never tried to organize the others to come out with him. He was also aware I had a boyfriend. He grabs my butt and says ""here let me help you up the stairs"" as I walked in front of him. I quickly said I was perfectly capable of walking up stairs myself. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, maybe his hands just slipped, right? Then he says we should watch a movie in my dorm room, so I invited my girlfriends. He kept trying to close my door multiple times to get me alone even though I told him to keep it open. My girlfriends took turns coming in to ""see whats up"" or ""ask me about chem homework"". He started to get visibly upset and frustrated. My girlfriends went to the boys‚Äô hall and had them come into the room. He left shortly after. Month later he drunk texts me hoping to meet up despite that night of me giving obvious signs of discomfort and telling him I no longer felt comfortable coming to volleyball anymore. It took my boyfriend at the time telling him to f*** off before he left me alone for good.

Oh yeah, and being catcalled

Senior year, I am 21. Two sophomore boys who got in with fake ids will not leave me and my girlfriends alone after we politely decline their drink offers at a bar near campus. We explain we are just enjoying our last night out before graduation. They call us stuck up for not having a beer with them and refuse to leave until we get drinks. I had to fake a phone call and announce that our friend was sick and vomiting just so we could get past them to leave the bar. 

Not to mention the multiple parties where guys just grab you and start grinding on you while you‚Äôre dancing with your girlfriends. FYI, being grabbed from behind and pulled backwards suddenly (and into a mans sweaty crotch) is terrifying. 0/10 do not recommend. Memorable ones include the guy at the co-ed honor society party who thought dancing with me meant it was ok to start licking the side of my face, grabbing my face to turn it toward him, and sticking his tongue down my throat. I made the excuse I needed the bathroom. I cried in a stall for 20 minutes and went home. Or how about the guy I was dancing face-to-face with at a bar,‚Äîno grinding mind you‚Äîand he just sticks his hand down my shorts and grabs me ""down there"". No permission. And as I try to pry his hand out from my shorts I have to explain ""I‚Äôm not into that"" -___-

21 years old. Working as a research coordinator at NIH, very low on the totem pole, I was alone in a room with a male patient training him for his fMRI. He was upset all the tests took so long and took it out on me. Fists clenched, pounding on the table, cussing at me, and yelling. I was scared he was going to hit me and had to excuse myself and call the doc. Later I was told if I am with a male patient I should always be seated by the door and have a table in between if possible. I still get nervous when i‚Äôm alone with a male patient. 

This is the big one. 21 years old. My boyfriend at that time had sex with me while I was asleep, without my permission, and without protection, I woke up during it, obviously upset. He said it ""must have been a dream he was having"" which is why he did it. He had anger issues and would scare me when we argued because he would punch things and yell. He had a tendency to let himself into my apartment with the spare key without giving me a heads up even though I said that was creepy and not okay. After the rape I knew I had to get out of the relationship but it took me a while to bring him down gently enough. He still stormed out in a rage, and after not hearing from him for months, he came back accusing me of posting nudes on reddit and slut-shaming me because he happened to stumble upon someone who looked similar to my body type and hair color when browsing reddit for porn to masturbate to. I can‚Äôt make this shit up folks. I was able to point out she didn‚Äôt have my birth marks nor lived in the same country. I blocked him on everything I can think of but I am still afraid he might come back again and do worse if he finds out where I moved to.

Did I mention being catcalled?

22 years old at an Ivy League MD-PhD interview. The interviewer asked me my age (he is not allowed to) but to be polite I tell him I‚Äôm 22. He asks if I am married (definitely not allowed to ask that). Again, being polite and trying not to piss of an ivy league interviewer, I say no. He says I‚Äôll be so old by the time I finish the program it will be hard for me to find a husband in [city]. I change the subject to what food is good in the city. He says lots of things are good but that I ""obviously don‚Äôt eat much because I have a slim figure"". I ended up withdrawing my application. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs an Ivy. I am perfectly fine in my non-Ivy League MD-PhD program. 

23 years old. Just started the medical school portion of my training in a school that started at 60:40 male:female student ratio and now at best is 65:35. One male classmate introduced himself to a bunch of us female students by asking ""who here is married and who is single"". 

A different white, male classmate lamented it took him 3 tries to get into medical school and  said to our faces ""it‚Äôs easier for women to get in because you‚Äôre a minority"".  In a separate interaction with the same student he implied I was elitist because I owned a car and did not give hitchhikers rides. I said I don‚Äôt feel safe giving strangers rides. He said it‚Äôs easy you just look for someone who looks respectable. I replied with ""didn‚Äôt Ted Bundy do that in this state and he killed women?"". Classmate says the only excuse that would be ok is if a person has been assaulted and then asked me ‚Äúso have you been assaulted?"" I told him yes, and by people I trusted. Completely unaware of the hole he was digging himself he asked for the details. I said I don‚Äôt share details of my assault with people I do not know. The female student walking on the other side of him had her mouth open the whole time in horror and later whispered ""definitely do not pick up hitchhikers here"" haha

Another, different classmate asked if it was ""my time of the month"" when he saw me taking a break during cadaver lab. No...it was the perforated colon in my room, but thanks for asking, Skip!

Oh and I still get catcalled. 

24 years old, almost present day. I am helping a patient at the VA. I ask if he has noticed any edema, or peripheral swelling. he said I was giving him a peripheral swelling in his pants since i‚Äôm so pretty ""if You know what I mean"". My male attending came in and he repeated the joke to him as well! Thankfully, my attending had my back and told the patient he could not talk to me that way. 

To be continued....

"This is my story. There are many like it, but this one is mine.",4,9kugfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9kugfy/this_is_my_story_there_are_many_like_it_but_this/,0,1538513146.0,"Courage is contagious. Just think about that for a second. It's true, right? People see others doing something courageous and generally look up to them with admiration. They want to be viewed as the brave, and find that strength inside themselves to do what they or others thought impossible. 

&#x200B;

This courage knows no bias over gender, skintone, body size or shape. It laughs at any who attempt to belittle others because of their traits. I know this to be true because I'm connected and part of this movement, and I maybe wouldn't be writing this otherwise but something happened to #MeToo.

&#x200B;

Watching all of these brave women coming out recently to speak up about their own incidents, it hit me like a ton of bricks. Today's political climate brought back those repressed memories, that I have a story too, one that I've kept to myself for more than half of my lifetime. It is embarassing, and I felt too ashamed to even talk about it. But I know now that that shame was irrational, that \*I\* am the victim here, and that stronger feeling of anger was the one I should have embraced more.

 

It was in the mid 1990s. I was a carless, careless young teenager, it was summetime and I had walked to the shopping center near my house, looking to meet up with friends and probably get into some sort of mischief. Some random guy stopped me and chatted me up for a while. He was older, probably at least twice my age, at least in his 30's with a medium stocky build and wavy/curly dark hair. He said he was looking for pot, and he promised a buzzworthy good time if I found some for him. I certainly knew better than to get into his silver van, but for some reason, I did. Perhaps the notion of a free buzz was enough for me to let down my guard, but I was a teenager looking for mischief. I blamed myself for years for getting into that van, but I know that's wrong now. I was the victim of a pedophile sexual predator.  

&#x200B;

He drove to the apartment complex across the street from that shopping center, where one of my friends lived. He parked facing away from the building I was going into to try to score some weed for this guy. I told him I'd be right back, and went up to the apartment to ""place an order"" but that involved calling another guy over to deliver the goods. I had a pager, we all did back then before cell phones were a thing. I told my friend to page me once he heard back from the weed guy, and went back to inform the guy in the van that we'd have to wait for a page. He inquired if I could get my hands on anything else and I told him that I had some acid. He got excited and said, ""Let's do some! How much is it? I'll pay for yours!"" So I said OK and took his money, gave him a hit of acid and watched him eat it, then pretended to eat a hit myself. Something was off, and I was too naive to notice what was going on but I wasn't about to start a long trip with this stranger. I knew it was headed south when he started saying he could feel it kicking in way faster than it should have, how acid makes him horny, and then he started to get really touchy with me. It started with him rubbing his hand up and down my leg, then he started rubbing himself and telling me it's ok, trying to do whatever he thought he could to make me comfortable. I was anything but. 

&#x200B;

Then, it happened. He pulled his penis out and started stroking it right there in front of me, and even told me to do the same. I was so shocked, I didn't know what to do. I then noticed that the van doors were locked and got really scared, so I complied. I knew I had to get out of there but I was frozen stiff. I was not prepared for this. Meanwhile he thoroughly enjoyed all of it, and I remember that beaming smile as he started to help stroke my penis with his free hand. He asked I've I'd ever had a blow job and went right in for it before I had a chance to process and attempt to reply. I remember the painful feeling of his teeth scraping against my penis. I remember pushing him off, and him saying, ""OK, now it's your turn!"" as he put his hand on the back of my head and pulled my face towards his penis. I remember pushing him away and unlocking that door, then running as fast as I've ever ran in my life to get away from that monster. I went back to my friend's apartment and felt so ashamed that I made up some story about the guy having to go somewhere and told them to call off the pot guy. I made sure that van was gone when I left that apartment, and I took the back ways and all the shortcuts I knew through the woods to stay off of the street in case he was driving around looking for me. I was terrified and alone. 

&#x200B;

Back in that van, I do remember trying not to show signs of panic when I realized that the doors were locked. I remember desperately hoping that there was no child safety lock set on my door. I remember looking around for something I could maybe use to hit him and bust the window with if the door wouldn't open as I frantically tried to plan my escape. I remember being so relieved with the lock released and the door opened, and I remember the immense feelings of gratitude and relief I felt when my friend opened his apartment door and let me in, rescuing me from that van of perversion. But I did not tell him this until last night. More than 20 years later. 

&#x200B;

That same pervert showed up at the shopping center a few days after this incident. He found my friend that lived in that apartment and asked him lots of questions about me. My friend called my house from a payphone to tell me that pervert was looking to meet up with me. And that same afternoon, I saw that van sitting outside of my house. I locked all of the doors, I couldn't go outside and face that man again. But I couldn't call the police and tell them there was a sexual predator sitting outside of my house. How could I explain the pot and acid? How could I tell anyone I let this man touch me and put his mouth on my penis? How could I tell my family this story? I was so ashamed of myself. How could I let this happen to me? I was so wrong to think that. 

&#x200B;

Now, I always thought that I was lucky to get away. Lucky that that's all that had happened. I still to this day think that if I hadn't gotten out of that van, I may never have been seen again. Perhaps this was rationalizing it, trying to make what happened ok to live with in my mind. I don't know. I am a survivor, but I tried to bury this. I was never going to think about what had happened or tell anyone about it, ever. Not even my best friend and soul mate. How foolish. I recently broke down and told my wife. We can't keep these sort of things pent up, or we'll explode like a pressure cooker left unattended for too long. 

&#x200B;

Looking back on this now, I don't know that I'll ever be able catch this guy. An event that happened over 20 years ago with little to go on beyond memories that shift from vague recollections to vivid details. No name, no license plate numbers, nothing to really go on. I'm more concerned about stopping him from hurting others than getting some sort of retribution, but I fear it's probably too late for that. Hopefully someone else spoke up and brought him to justice. I don't know where I'm heading with this now, I am not here seeking pity, but I hope my story helps you find the strength to tell your own, and maybe you can help to stop someone from doing what they did to you again with someone else.

Was this assault?,2,9jxfj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9jxfj4/was_this_assault/,7,1538232630.0,"I've been skipping through life thinking how lucky I am to have never been raped. 
A lot of my girlfriends have been posting their stories and it's been making me angry reading what's been done to them. 
While doing yoga this morning a memory hit me that I haven't thought about ever. It's very real and I remember the incident too well, but I've never considered it to be assault until now when I look at it in a different context. I still don't really know if it counts or not. I guess I always pictured it like how it happens in the movies and that hasn't happened to me. So please, tell me if this qualifies as sexual assault or if I'm just being dramatic? 

It was 17 years ago. I was 18. He was 19. I was the only girl in a group of male friends. We had all hung out all night at this guys house. Stayed up all night. At this point I didn't drink or do drugs. I think we all fell asleep or passed out in the wee hours of the morning. I woke up to find my pants pulled down and this guy with his face between my legs. I internally panicked but just pretended to be asleep. I rolled over at point and pulled the blanket up to get him to stop. He did. But I felt gross especially since I'd only ever been intimate with one guy-and this wasn't him. 
So I never said no. I didn't even freak out and slap him away. I was shocked at what was happening and didn't know what to do. I froze. 

So was I assaulted because I never gave permission for this ""friend"" to touch me intimately?",2,0,meToo,Fl3shwound,1,2018-09-29 17:50:30

At the time I had just come out of the closet. I only told one person about it, and they laughed and told me I should get a promotion.

The whole thing still makes me very uncomfortable to think about. But given my friend‚Äôs response, maybe I‚Äôm overreacting? I still work in the industry and feel like it‚Äôs not something I can talk about.

My story that I kept,2,8mfdpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8mfdpl/my_story_that_i_kept/,0,1527392811.0,"And I need to say it out loud 

I feel like it‚Äôs unfair what happened to me. I wasn‚Äôt hurt physically and I wasn‚Äôt hurt truthfully but I‚Äôm traumatized and psychologically tormented. 


My story. 
My parents divorced and I was taken by my mother to live with her in Las Vegas in my early teens. 

I didn‚Äôt like it. I thought the first time I‚Äôve seen the billboard of women disgust me, I was innocent naive little girl. 
I often beg my mom to let me go home back to my family but she wouldn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt let me. 
I was going to school feeling so depressed my friends didn‚Äôt know why I am so miserable. It‚Äôs because I hate this town so much and I have a good instinct that if I don‚Äôt leave bad things will happen to me and it did. 
Series of unfortunate events kept happening. 
And I‚Äôve lost my desire to live many times and in fact so miserable now that I feel like my soul have been sucked out of me.

I thought this is what majority of the people are like. This is what it is like being a woman until I read people‚Äôs stories on metoo campaign. 
But my story is different. I thought I‚Äôve always been feminist because I was born in some privileged and always knew if I work hard I didn‚Äôt need men to help me do what I want in life. 
But it Vegas it seems like it.

Teenage.
One day a classmate sitting next to me was talking to his friend about pornography. I was only barely 15 and disgusted at porn. I saw prostitution in Vegas all the time and I think those women are weak and like they have no human rights.
Like I don‚Äôt think any women will ever dream of being prostitute when they grew up. These women are 18-23 years old.
That upsets my stomach and i said I need to get the hell out of here else I‚Äôll be like one of them one day. 
I knew that being poor is the reason why these girls end up in this situation.

In my early teens all I want is to move out to New York and maybe work in the art industry. 
Art is my only shelter and place I want to be. Sad now how Hollywood is the place of sexual harassment, that women in this world really seen as weak. 
I began talking to men because I think it‚Äôs my ticket out of Vegas. 
If it weren‚Äôt for my insecurities I would‚Äôve been in trouble. One day a 32 years old want to meet me, I was about 16-17 years old. But in Vegas consent is 16.
I didn‚Äôt meet him and stopped talking to him. At 17 I met this guy and about 18-19, he told me that he can‚Äôt wait anymore, he didn‚Äôt want to kept emailing me, to get to know me, he want to see me and if i don‚Äôt show up he‚Äôll stop talking to me. So I was forced to meet him that day. We‚Äôve met in public place he was about in his late 30s. 
I got into his car and drove. He was inspecting me like how much worth I have. I didn‚Äôt realized this until I was on my 20s that he was a pimp. We didn‚Äôt worked out. He didn‚Äôt liked me. He asked me how open I was, and at the age of 19, he was asking me how many men I‚Äôve been with and how open minded I am. Those were definitely red flags for a pimp to be asking an 18-19 years old. 

More miseries: 
My stepdad is addicted to pornography. I was definitely scared that I‚Äôm alone with him on some days and he will be watching his porn and I‚Äôm scared that he might do something to me. But I need to sleep on my days off. 
I told this to my boyfriend and I thought my boyfriend is different than men in Vegas. I thought he was the one and don‚Äôt have addiction because i confide that my stepdad is scaring me when he‚Äôs watching his porn when we‚Äôre alone in the house and I can hear it from his bedroom it disgust and scared me. 
When my boyfriend and I live together, things unravel and he showed his true color. He is also addicted to porn and when I confront him about it he said he isn‚Äôt. 
He said every man is watching porn. 
He watch porn every morning, and night and want me to partake in them. He wants me to do what those women do. Not only he‚Äôs watching porn but he is also sending his private parts pictures in women, chatting to those women and flirting with them. 
When I begged him many times for him to stop he won‚Äôt. 
I was having panic attacks because I was begging him to stop. 
But he won‚Äôt stop and it‚Äôs hurting me so much. 
I feel stuck that now I‚Äôm unemployed and lost my car and my job that I have nothing else but him. 
It if were easy to get a job but in Vegas it‚Äôs not easy for me to get a job. And I began to resent that city so much I hate it. All I want to do is leave and never come back. 
I can‚Äôt put on smile on my face to want to work on customer service jobs which is all Vegas have. 

But also stuck because I have no money to leave. 

All these just pilled up and I think of all the men in Vegas. 
All men were predators preying on young vulnerable women like me. 
And I can‚Äôt go to school without money. So I am stuck forever living in miserable city. 

I was harassed on the street many times. With my fear of being unemployed at this age, I began to think I can‚Äôt get a job and they‚Äôre pushing me to become a stripper or prostitute. 
Because I‚Äôve applied hundreds and the jobs that quickly willing to interview me were wanting me to be cocktail waitress. 
I worked with full clothes and I still get harassed by men, and if I wear those clothes, I feel like I jumped into the fire and let myself burn. 
Numerous times when I tried leaving Vegas, and it disgust me the thought of living in Vegas that I want nothing to do with it but just want to be invisible. And many of those time I‚Äôm harassed on the street asked by man if I want a ‚Äúride‚Äù and when I said no, he yelled at me and said I shouldn‚Äôt be wearing these kinds of clothing! I was wearing leggings and clogs and walking home. Why am I not allowed to wear what I want. Since then I want to be invisible I stopped wearing nice clothes and no make up on. I don‚Äôt want to interact with any men, I avoid them all. 
I became so fearful of people. 
One time I was going to a party and a man stopped by and said he was lonely and have no friends, I was 16 years old, he was insisting that I should let him give me a ride to the party. The woman beside me didn‚Äôt intervene. It is that easy to get preyed in Vegas because people there don‚Äôt care about anyone but themselves. 

People always looked miserable. No one smile at you. No one greets anyone. Unfriendly and rude city. 
That those who were ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù and ‚Äúcharming‚Äù were only in it because they want something out of you. 

The last time I was so depressed and alone, I put on my dating profile that I want to take it slow and maybe just looking for friends. 
All men I‚Äôve met want me to come over and cuddle. 
One man I‚Äôve talked to that haunt me to this days have told me that I am so miserable, no men will ever date me. 
The other guy preyed on me when I said I just want to become friends. When I got into his car, I knew he was horny and want to have sex with me. He said come closer and something happened then. I didn‚Äôt know how to react but I knew I regret it to have happened. 
He was obsessed and was calling me nonstop. 
I was so distressed for 2 months I can‚Äôt walk outside like I used to. 
I was afraid that he‚Äôll be there waiting for me in his car. 

Lastly, for those who like Vegas, I know I‚Äôm not here to bash that town. 
But there is more bad than good that happened to me there. 
Every city have their own problems and any city is just like Vegas and i were in la id probably encounter the same, i don‚Äôt know.

But I just want to finally write my experience here because it somehow made me feel better. 
One day I‚Äôm planning of writing my biography. 
Because I knew Vegas is my reason for downfall. 
Because I‚Äôve done everything that I could and if I didn‚Äôt encounter those men in my life, I would have been okay.

Hopefully it‚Äôs not too late for me and I can find happiness again. And boyfriend that is loyal, kind and doesn‚Äôt put porn before me.

"My recent ""sexual abuse""/""rape"" story involving my newlywed Husband (NSFW)",2,8lqr3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/8lqr3l/my_recent_sexual_abuserape_story_involving_my/,5,1527146148.0,"So, after many long teary-eyed nights, I decided I need to reach out and ask others what they would classify my experience as. 


back story--
He's a very loving Husband who has held me for hours whenever I've had one of my many anxiety attacks where I'm a sobbing mess(which is beyond what I could expect out of a spouse, he's incredibly emotionally accommodating for my needy ass) 
I look up to him as a person, and I would have never imagined that something like what I'm about to tell you about could have /ever/ happened...I'm still processing it all...

To put it bluntly -- 
My Husband was drinking more than he should the other night. 
Flat out drunk. Which, in the past has never been a problem. 
(Nothing violent, no history of previously even raising his voice at me much less doing anything to try and actively hurt me) 
But that night...(NSFW Warning):
He insisted that he wanted to eat my pussy out, and get me off. (At the time he was torn up from having sex previously a day or so ago, but still was horny)
I plainly stated that I wasn't really interested in doing anything that night. That I'd rather wait until he's healed because I'd rather just have sex than him masturbate for me essentially (because I wasn't interested in having my Husband go down on me, it's just something that has me more in my head and gives me anxiety than something I can relax while it's happening) 
I insisted, ""I'm not really interested in that...""
So many times...
Did I need to say ""no""?
Should I have to say ""no?""
When I say, ""I'm not interested in that, or I don't think I want to do that"" and be continually pressured into something
until finally he says, ""I'm /going/ to eat your pussy out tonight""
...

I was shocked, I didn't know what to think
I felt uncomfortable that he was so confident that it was something I absolutely wanted and that he was going to pleasure me in a way that I did /Not/ o.k so to speak directly
The words he said just rattled in my brain and I in a sense went into a corner in my mind and crawled up into a ball 
hoping to just disappear from the moment 

I cried so much.
For what reason to do that except for your own pleasure? 

I'm a very sexual woman, and I RARELY (maybe 5% or less of the time) reject my husband when he suggest sex/sexual acts to do. 

I don't know how to feel

I think I was raped.,2,88ybyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/88ybyt/i_think_i_was_raped/,11,1522665058.0,"I was in an on and off relationship with a man for about 4 years.
I always knew sex was important to him. He would literally end our relationships on a whim, blocking me on every social medium, because someone else had caught his interest. Then he would come back the second they made him upset.
When we officially got together, things were fine for a while- then my sex drive plummeted because of a mood stabilizer I‚Äôd been placed on. I asked him to be patient and try to offer support.
Instead, I got screamed at until 9 in the morning, to the point that I was vomiting and had to miss work. I was called every name in the book, constantly threatened with cheating/leaving, and taunted with recounts of girls who had ‚Äúthrown themselves at him‚Äù at work. Eventually, I gave in, though the sex was physically painful and I often had to leave the room to cry afterwards. I‚Äôve told him this, and his response was simple: ‚ÄúI needed sex‚Äù.
He was also physically abusive, often choking me during arguments, extremely verbally abusive and financially (stole $300 cash from me, leaving me stranded overseas with nothing)
It has been close to two years since we parted ways- I haven‚Äôt had sex since and honestly have very little desire to. I‚Äôve found myself getting blackout drunk when faced with a situation where I‚Äôm alone with a male friend, even one I trust. My outlook is that sex is just something I need to get over with if someone wants to have it with me. It‚Äôs far easier than the consequences the alternative could have.
I probably won‚Äôt remember writing this. I snapped a couple days ago after having a nightmare about a time he held me down by my throat, groping me while I yelled at him to stop, after 5/6 times he left me alone crying, leaving the room mumbling ‚Äústupid cunt‚Äù.
To be fair it had literally been months...... mostly due to my entire being tensing up every time he touched me. His behaviour terrified me. Is this how all men react when deprived of sex? He has a serious girlfriend now (moved in with her shortly after we broke up) and honestly, it destroys me to think that maybe  I‚Äôm the only one he has treated that way. They seem healthy from what I‚Äôve heard.
It‚Äôs gotten bad. Lately I‚Äôve almost become agoraphobic. We live in the same city and the thought of seeing him or his friends makes me want to vomit. I‚Äôve been lashing out at friends and family, drinking heavily and threatening suicide. I‚Äôve developed a fixation on cleaning my body, bathing in scalding water 3x per day. And yet, a part of me misses him, even the abuse. It makes me feel horrible knowing he‚Äôs with someone else and apparently treating her with respect I never got. Maybe if I had treated him better I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this (I was abusive too). Maybe the sexual abuse was his way of regaining control.
I plan to commit suicide on my 24th birthday. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll change my mind. I barely leave my house, I feel like he owns the entire city. I still feel him in my body sometimes. This is too much to carry with me: I‚Äôve taken lots of sleeping pills ",2,0,meToo,laissetomber92,1,2018-04-02 13:30:58

Turned down promotion for fear of #metoo,2,81r4zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/81r4zb/turned_down_promotion_for_fear_of_metoo/,22,1520094509.0,"I need to talk to somebody, but due to the nature of the topic, I really don't want to talk to anybody who can identify me to say, work. Or public. Not because I've done anything wrong, quite the contrary. Because I'm terrified of the work-environment I find myself today as a man.

I was asked yesterday to step up to a new position which would require me to train an attractive female co-worker (whom I have met once) in my truck alone for several weeks. Some of the lesser-brained, blinder, deafer members of my gender (that is, cissgender male) might hear this news, and that she is about my age, and celebrate with whoops and hollers about lucky me, getting to spend this time with this pretty girl. You poor, empty headed fools.

I'm crushing life right now. I've got a good job that I like in a tough economy with an idiot PM. I'm in pretty decent shape, work out regularly, live alone in a house, have a personal vehicle in addition to my work truck, etc. A pretty good thing going, moving forward towards my goals(and paying for them.) I don't have problems with women, and I don't need one in my work environment to increase my odds, so really I saw no benefit to this and only potential harm.

The harm being that especially after this most recent false allegation which destroyed the career of Patrick Brown (Ontario, Canada) it's unbelievably clear to me that any woman at any time can say any thing and no matter how many witnesses or video proof you have to the contrary, the allegation will destroy your entire life in hours. They're even pushing for the media to remove the term ""allegation"" from the news and call anybody accused, a sex offender. The LAST thing I want is to be stuck in a truck for 8-14 hours a day with somebody who has the power to end my entire LIFE with a few lies. Or worse, what if I say something or answer some question in a way that offends her subjective taste, and suddenly she is telling the news how she felt ""trapped"" inside my truck for hours and hours etc. Or what if she decides to claim I'm making ""unwanted sexual advances"" which todays society equates to full on rape. She could claim I spent too long looking in her direction while checking a rearview mirror, or leaned in too close around the lap-top to explain something, and BAM my life is over. Everything I've been working so damn hard for is gone up in smoke, just like that. I don't want to be the next male victim of this #metoo witchhunt.

It's important to me you all realize how serious of an issue sexual assault is (not just against women, @Joy Behar groping Robin Williams, for example) and that it's important we try to protect people from these situations. Real rape and real sexual assault do happen and they are serious and women do need to be believed, it needs to be investigated with due process, not this tribunal of public opinion we have today. All these false accusations are doing is hurting the real victims of real sexual assault and making good men like me who never have and never would violate a person's boundaries like that, male or female, terrified of working with or being alone with any woman any where lest they be burned during this witch hunt.

To the men who hoot like beta males, telling me to be alpha etc.. What exactly do you think is alpha about being a slave to what's between a woman's legs? Do you honestly think that should be more important than all the work you have done in your life to buy land or a house or whatever it is you're working on and for? Do you honestly think some sort of macho ""Make her love it!"" posturing like a peacock is what makes you an alpha? Each of us chooses their own path and I won't begrudge you yours. I am not afraid of women. I am simply not so beholden to what their sex has to offer me that I would let it sway the path I choose to walk, and any man who DOES allow a woman to sway him in such a way is no alpha, in my humble opinion.

I've already turned down the promotion, told them I would if they absolutely could not find somebody else, but otherwise I ""Didn't feel I was the best choice for the job"" on account of seniority in the company. I considered telling my employer directly why I declined, but doing so would just open me up to discrimination charges. Such is the position I feel myself placed in by this #metoo witch hunt.

I would like your input, reddit. Your scathing comments calling me a p***y, your outraged SJW left wing fascist ""how dare you discriminate"", but especially any real life experiences or advice for this. I know I'm not the only one ""leaning out"" after the ""lean in"" and ""metoo"" movements. I know many men have adopted mike pence rules and stopped taking on females to mentor for this exact reason. But I'm kind of pissed off that not only did I feel I had to decline, I feel I can't talk about it openly without being crucified even more.

My country allows us to change gender by choice from moment to moment, maybe I should just choose to be a black woman or an asian woman, and distance myself from the oppression of white males in society that way xD! (No, that's not a serious solution, or I'd choose to be a Jeep, beep beep!) Any help or advice is welcome.

I had a guy friend I had known since I was 7 years old. Neighbors, always played together growing up and nothing had every transpired than more than a regular childhood crush. We went to elementary school together and high school, and never had any romantic involvement with each other. We would call each other for relationship advice about our respective situations and so forth. I decide to invite him over to my house to hangout, have a drink. I don't remember anything from that night, other than waking up the next morning with him penetrating me. Horrified I scream and ask what the fuck he's doing. My best guy friend proceeds to tell me we had sex the previous night and that I was crying while it was happening but he didn't know why because I appeared to be ""fine"". He them tells me thats why he decided to have sex with me in the morning so that I would remember..ok. I get up. Confused as to if maybe this was my fault because I drank too much and maybe he thought I was aware of what was going on at the time since my eyes where apparently open. Who knows. Years later I still think about that situation and can't figure out what it was that happened that made it so traumatizing for me.

Something that‚Äôs been bothering me,2,7pt673,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7pt673/something_thats_been_bothering_me/,3,1515721314.0,"So I‚Äôm not sure if this counts but for months this has been eating at me..I‚Äôd really appreciate a response

 about a year and a half ago I was with my (f) now ex (f) who I left about a year ago.

We would have sex almost every night and after awhile I was getting really tired of it, I just didn‚Äôt want to anymore, so one night I finally told her that I didn‚Äôt want to have sex and she immediately began pouting at me and trying to guilt me into having sex anyways ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be frustrated if you don‚Äôt fuck me!‚Äù Things like that, and eventually I‚Äôd give in if she pouted and guilted me long enough, and so for months I just did her (without asking for anything in return) because it meant have her upset at me or just give her what she wants.

Recently it‚Äôs just been eating away at me, my current girlfriend has been supportive of me but it still messes with me

With a bit of background: I have a hard time saying no because of a history of parental emotional abuse growing up. If i told them no that meant I would upset them and I would be in trouble because of it. Saying no meant I don‚Äôt get love.

So in your opinion..does this technically count as rape? I said no but she guilted me into it..I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty as well because I just let her have her way..but it‚Äôs just been eating at me..

I learned a lot about my friends in a very short amount of time. Every post I saw on Facebook told a story of sexual harassment or sexual assault. At each one I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. I want you to know you‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù

A few months later, I don't see any more #metoo stories in my feed. To many, it may feel like the movement never even happened. But that doesn‚Äôt mean those experiences didn‚Äôt.

Earlier this year, I started a project called Afterward., a submissions-based blog of personal stories about change to help others navigate the unknown after. Basically, I collect strangers' stories about ""what happens after...?"" What happens after a loved one dies? What happens after you move across the country? What happens after you're sexually assaulted?

I want to gather a community of people, both women and men, who can offer support from someone who‚Äôs been there. We can‚Äôt end sexual harassment and sexual assault in a day, or maybe even in our lifetimes. What we can do is reach out to others and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there too, and I‚Äôm here now.‚Äù

I've hesitated sharing this. The shame felt from this event is something that I still struggle with. I've hardly ever spoken of this and only a very select few people know about this part of my life. Maybe me telling my story will help just one person though, and sharing it is then worth it.

Much of my memory regarding this event still hasn't been recovered. In fact, until about 18 months ago, my brain had managed to make me totally forget it ever happened. I spent decades blocking details out and protecting myself. It seems that I've managed to block out some details permanently. Part of me wishes that I could remember all of the details of this horrific event so that I could grieve properly. The other part of me is thankful that I can't remember the blocked out parts. I was 15 and met a guy on a phone chat line since the internet wasn't huge yet. His name was Kyle. He was older, he was 21. He asked to meet me by my house. We did. He then asked me to go back to his place to watch the super bowl. It was Super Bowl Sunday in 2000. I was hesitant, but eventually agreed. He promised to take me home right after the game. The moment that we got to his apartment, I knew I was in serious trouble and that I might never make it home.

There's a lot of memories of this event that I still don't have because my brain went into preservation mode. I can't tell you exactly how many days he held me captive, but it was at least 5. I can't tell you exactly where all he kept me, he kept us on the move. I can't even tell you how I finally got free and home except I know I got to a payphone at a gas station while he was in the bathroom and called my mom and just said our safe word. He found me and cut the call off. She says she spent hours driving around looking for me in the city the call came from.

What I do remember is the time we got pulled over in a stolen car. As the officer approached our car, he let me know if I told him anything, a cop's death would be on my hands. I gave a false name and age. Unfortunately, the car hadn't been reported stolen yet. I remember the gut wrenching realization that I wasn't going to be rescued. I do remember him taking me home to get clean clothes and having to tell my family I was gone voluntarily and to go to hell for threatening to call the police on me for being a run away. I do remember hoping my mom could see in my face that I needed to be rescued. I do remember him taking me to my job at Blockbuster, to avoid suspicion, and standing in the window for my 8 hour shift and him coming in every time a customer was in there to ensure I wasn't telling anyone anything. I do remember his sister who lived with him, knew I was in trouble, and was too afraid to help me because she was protecting her toddler son. Instead she told us both to leave even after it was beyond clear I was being held against my will.

What I assume must be the worst of the event, I can't remember. I do know that when I managed to flee and get home, I never spoke of what happened. I didn't tell anyone that I was forcibly held against my will. I hid the bruises. I didn't say anything because I felt like it was my fault for meeting a stranger. I felt that no one would believe me because I was a troubled teenager. I felt alone and terrified that he would come back and kill me for talking. I MUST have asked for this to happen to me.

In August of that year, my mom came to my room and said, ""That Kyle guy is on the news, I think. Come see if it's the same person.""

He was arrested for raping a 10 year old child.

He's currently serving a life sentence. Had I not been afraid of speaking up, maybe that child would have been spared. Maybe if someone recognized the signals I was giving, that child would have been spared. Maybe if women weren't made to feel like they're ""asking"" for it, I would have spoken up.
I plan to contact the Florida Department of Corrections this week to find out how I can be notified when he is up for parole so that I can go and be heard. He may not be in prison for the crimes committed against me, but I can't allow him to ever be free. If he is ever released, he will find a new victim... only this time, he will know he has to kill them to keep them silent. I can't let that happen. I'm no longer a scared and ashamed little girl.

I have a #metoo problem at work,2,77kyzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/77kyzh/i_have_a_metoo_problem_at_work/,3,1508490914.0,"Sorry it‚Äôs long (in an epic way) but it relates to a serious problem I (50M) have with my (22F) employee.  We work in a large company within a very fast paced industry...  it‚Äôs tough to get to the top.

Background: I‚Äôm a fat, balding 50 yr old that has never had problems attracting/dating girls.  I‚Äôve churned through more meaningless relationships than a decent person would do, and had a habit in the past of attracting the wrong girls (because to be honest I was the wrong guy).

I‚Äôve almost reached the highest I can in my company...  don‚Äôt love the company...  but have a good reputation in the industry.

I settled down about 10 years ago after playing the field over and over...  great wife now...  three awesome kids...   great career (always had a great career)...  BUT:

A new girl came in my team about 3 months ago and she‚Äôs is young and stupid, but to be honest she has lots of potential in her field.

The first month was fine,  she was settling in...  but her over-confidence and inappropriate behaviour went too far today.

Let me explain...

About 2 months ago she was visibly upset on the Monday so I pulled her aside to see what was going on.  She apologised and said it was ‚Äúrelationship problems‚Äù.  I terminated the conversation as quickly as I could because to be honest I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúfeeling manager‚Äù...  I don‚Äôt really care about her relationship problems. Not good, but true.

Over the next week she‚Äôs chatty...  she seems to have gotten over whatever upset her and then one day she comes into my office to apologise for Monday ‚Äúbut my boyfriend stayed out the whole weekend and all I wanted him to do was come home and pull my hair and spank my ass -  that‚Äôs not too much to ask is it?‚Äù

I terminated the conversation without responding and to be honest it made me feel uncomfortable because by my measure my wife would have been pissed off hearing that. (Thus the throwaway because my wife would be furious if she knew this).

Over the next week a few things happened like her showing me photos of her scantily clothed friends as examples of what they wear when they go out clubbing ‚ÄúI might get slutty but I don‚Äôt dress slutty like that.‚Äù

Again,  uncomfortable...

She has an Asian boyfriend and commented to me one day, ‚ÄúI love him but I want to be man-handled sometimes,  you know,  used by a bigger man.‚Äù

Uncomfortable!  In hindsight I should have addressed the problem at this point but i didn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs continued.

She has met my wife when my wife came to the office one day and flatly said to me afterwards, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs hot,  I bet you guys are at it every night.‚Äù

At that point I said ‚ÄúThats inappropriate [insert name here]. Please try to maintain some professionalism,‚Äù which she just made a joke out of.

Now she says stuff like, ‚ÄúI know I have to be professional but my boyfriend is taking me away this weekend and I‚Äôm ready for it!‚Äù

Another time she said (about her upcoming holiday), ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to Tokyo so it‚Äôs pointless to be unprofessional and sneak away from my boyfriend because I‚Äôm hardly going to find a big cock in Japan!‚Äù

I‚Äôm serious...  this has been getting worse and worse...

So today was the Clanger...  and I feel like I need to take some action,  but it‚Äôs difficult.

I could hear her and a colleague talking outside my office door about elite sports men taking steroids blah blah blah... later she come into my office and says, ‚Äúmy friends boyfriend takes steroids.  Is it true guys on ‚Äòroids need to cum like three times a day?‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúI have no idea,  I‚Äôm busy,  close the door.‚Äù

Then she comes out and says, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs going to dump him because she hates the taste of cum [pauses then laughs as she says], but I love it‚Äù.

So we all know it‚Äôs gone too far but I am certain I won‚Äôt be believed if I raise it with HR.

Even if they believed it and tried subtle action no one else is going to believe it.

I‚Äôve mentioned some of it with a trusted colleague and his only response was, ‚ÄúI heard her say something about hair pulling (I mentioned that incident, but not the seriousness of others) but didn‚Äôt know what she was on about.  Just go ahead and fuck her!‚Äù

The company culture is a bit like that.  One manager in a different region was caught fucking his PA at the companies annual conference and it was laughed off as ‚ÄúFuck mate,  keep it private.‚Äù

So...  what I‚Äôve done:

- I can‚Äôt completely avoid contact with her but every now and then it‚Äôs unavoidable to go out of the office for meetings with her clients

- I am diarising each of these incidents but frankly it won‚Äôt help me if it all turns to shit

- I stay away from her as much as possible but a few days ago someone in the office said to me ‚Äúdo you have a problem with [insert her name here] because I‚Äôve noticed you‚Äôre very cold towards her.

I‚Äôm m not an indecisive person,  I am usually in control of every situation BUT human instinct tells me to fuck the living daylights out of her,  the loving husband and father tells me not to be a complete idiot,  the professional in me tells me to get rid of her as soon as I can and the realist in me tells me this is not going to end well.

I feel like the hunter has become hunted, and it‚Äôs like I am being tested to the extreme in many different ways.

Advice would be appreciated.

I‚Äôm anxious about the next steps!",2,0,meToo,tourturedATwork,1,2017-10-20 12:15:14

I was harassed when I was 14 by a school teacher. I need to keep telling my story!,1,b8otux,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b8otux/i_was_harassed_when_i_was_14_by_a_school_teacher/,3,1554238695.0,"I‚Äôm new here to this subreddit and I have also posted this particular story on several forums already on this site. However, I will post my extended narrative for this subreddit as I have remembered quite a lot since my original post. 

I want to get my story out there as I have kept my version of events secret for far too long.  I feel it‚Äôs important that I keep telling my story to others, as many young men or women around my age in this story may not know what is appropriate for a teacher to do in a classroom environment. Granted that this story may not measure up to many accounts I have read on this subreddit but I feel it‚Äôs still important to keep telling my story; even if it is for my own sake. Even if it only makes me feel better! 

I apologise for the length of my story as this happened over the course of a school year of 2013/2014, therefore some of the details I am remembering as I write them. 

So let‚Äôs begin shall we?

I am a 20 year old female now living in North East Scotland. I was living in Central Scotland with my parents and sister when this happened to me but I will not disclose any of my specific locations as they are not important to my tale.
These events took place during my third year of high school when I was only 14 years old. Please note that at that stage in my life I was a quite and reserved individual, not one to make a scene. I am drastically different now as a result of the many traumatic events that occurred in my life, this story being one of those many things! 

Anyway, at the end of the summer of that year I had lost my uncle to the cancer he had suffered with for two years. It wasn‚Äôt the happiest of times for me as you can imagine. The funeral took place the day I was due to start up at  school again; yet I was encouraged to go in the following day regardless.

My first class of the year is where I met him for the first time.

For the sake of this story I will refer to him as Mr Stone. Now Mr Stone was a young teacher, I‚Äôd probably say in his early to mid twenties, and at a glance he didn‚Äôt look like your stereotypical creeper. He was about average height, dark hair and eyes and had a wispy thin goatee on his chin. I initially thought he looked like a wizard or a waiter or something shit like that.

Now I‚Äôd love to say that the moment I first met him he gave me a bad vibe or whatever but I‚Äôd be lying if I did. I thought he was funny, a little strange yeah, but not at all intimidating at first. 

I don‚Äôt remember much of the first few lessons in class as I more or less just minded my own business.

It started off with little things such as prolonged glances over at me, lingering around the area I was doing my work in and complementing me in front of my peers. By this time most people would assume he favoured me or something, which is an overstatement in my opinion. I was already feeling a little uncomfortable in class around Mr Stone but it wasn‚Äôt anything I couldn‚Äôt handle I believed. I just wanted to get on with my work and pass to be honest. 

However, I soon realised that what I thought I could handle was something way too problematic for me to deal with alone. Yet that‚Äôs exactly what I did.  

In the months that followed things were beyond uncomfortable for me. What I initially thought was harmless actions that I misinterpreted turned into a hurricane of confusion for my younger self. I noticed that he was beginning to get even more creepy towards me as I‚Äôd catch him staring at me from across the class, winking suggestively at me when no one was looking, giving me pet names such ‚Äúhis angel‚Äù or ‚Äúhis little star‚Äù, trying to get me to stand closer to him when I already was close enough to touch him etc.

I can even recall specific events where he‚Äôd obvious was trying to keep my back when the bell had already rung or even get my alone at specific points in the lesson. He did this to no one else. He used a variety of different methods and excuses to isolate me from my classmates.He use to give me extra textbook work so he could mark it while my peers were left to do other fun activities. He told my friends at my table that ‚Äúhe only wanted to talk to me because I worked hard ‚Äù when they requested basic assistance with whatever task they were doing. He even demonstrated how projectiles work with some science contraption then asked if I ‚Äúwanted a shot of his ball launcher‚Äù in a suggestive tone when I was just about to leave for my next class. 

He also told me that ‚ÄúI reminded him of his girlfriend‚Äù which was beyond weird in my opinion. I was a baby faced 14 year old, not a woman closer to his own age. 

I can also clearly remember that one of the classmates I sat with noticed his behaviour and asked if he can ‚Äúfilm him in the act‚Äù but I obviously declined. I wish I didn‚Äôt now as this situation would have been over a lot quicker and I wouldn‚Äôt have had to deal with this. 

For most of the time I spent with him in that time period, I was on the receiving end of Mr Stone‚Äôs unwanted attention. I was constantly being stared at, isolated, touched in several areas of my body with classroom equipment, ‚Äúcomplimented‚Äù and being at the receiving end of his attention in the halls and learning environment. I recall trying to take days off and even trying to make myself physically ill just so I couldn‚Äôt endure the atmosphere in that room. Stupid I know but I was young and didn‚Äôt know what to do or even if I could do anything. 

Finally the end of the school year rolled around and our school did a ‚Äúchange of timetable‚Äù a few weeks before summer. This meant we‚Äôd get settled into our new classes so after summer we knew where to go and what to do when we got there. 

My last lesson with Mr Stone was an ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù one. My peers were clearly upset over the fact that this is their last day with this man, not me, I was glad to say the least. Ecstatic would be a better word. However, I really should have anticipated that Mr Stone would take full advantage of his limited time left with me. He had openly expressed that he wanted me in his class next year and said this to me in a way that it should make me feel flattered. Like somehow that was a privilege. In that same time span he admitted that I was indeed his favourite student, with a little persuasion from a friend. The same routine of eyeing me up, trying to isolate me and generally making me uncomfortable followed this new knowledge on my finally day with him. I got use to it by now. 

However, I finally found the courage to express that I was uncomfortable with him standing so close to me. Somehow that translated to me admitting I have a crush on him (WHICH I CLEARLY DID NOT!) and led him to humiliate me in front of my peers. I cried my whole bus journey home that day as I was so embarrassed and dumbfounded that he genuinely thought I liked him like that. 

Firstly, it was inappropriate. I am a lesbian also and HE MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNSAFE IN A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT FOR A WHOLE ACADEMIC YEAR!

WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO THINK THAT THIS WAS THE CASE HERE?

Thankfully, I wasn‚Äôt in Mr Stone‚Äôs class the following year as I would have been the only female in the class if I was. However, his behaviour never stopped there. Whenever he‚Äôd see me in the halls he‚Äôd always make a point to try and get my attention by either waving or staring at me from wherever he was. It was always when no one was looking or when no one was around. Always! 

This brings me to the 3rd year class trip to Alton Towers. He found any and all excuses to talk to me without the detection of other staff members while on this trip. Whenever another teacher was around he did his best to ignore me and continued to chaperone us kids. It didn‚Äôt stop the constant glances in my direction though. 

A few other students, and my own mother, witnessed this disgusting behaviour at various different points and occasions but nothing ever did come of these actions.

He left the school I attended in November 2014 and I have neither heard or seen him since thankfully.

Now I bet you‚Äôre all wondering why I didn‚Äôt report him to anyone at the time?

To put it simply: I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure if I could. 

The people who did see some of these events moved on after he left, no authority figure ever caught him doing anything I have listed, he was well liked among the students at my high school and, as many other people have pointed out when I tell them my story, he never actually ‚Äúdid‚Äù something to me.  

Saying this, If I could go back in time I would have reported these events as I have came to learn that it doesn‚Äôt matter if someone ‚Äúdid‚Äù something to you. If someone is persistently giving you unwanted attention then you are within your rights to report it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the person harassing you is your friend, co worker, classmate, lecturer, coach or teacher. 

You shouldn‚Äôt have to stay silent.

I wish someone could have told me that when I was 14 then maybe I would have spoke up against him then. Maybe I could of stopped this happening to other young high school students. 

I was too uncomfortable. 
I was too scared.

I am no longer scared of anyone anymore! ",1,0,meToo,conspiracy_artist_20,1,2019-04-02 23:58:15

Person who assaulted me now works where I do,1,b8hwbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b8hwbv/person_who_assaulted_me_now_works_where_i_do/,0,1554203940.0,"Trigger warning: sexual assault 

Sorry if this the wrong place to post this 

When I was in the 7th grade I was friends with this guy. I knew he liked me but I friend zoned him hard because I didn't like him back obviously. One day in science class we were watching a movie so the lights were off. I was sitting in the back row with him when he leaned over and stuck his hand down the back of my pants and basically played with my butt/vaginal area for the better part of 15 minutes. I was young, stupid, and too scared to even say anything so I just let him. I was just shocked honestly. I haven't let it take over my life, but it still upsets me to think about it. I continued to be his friend for the rest of our schooling because I was lonely and didn't have a lot of friends. I know this is a stupid reason and I have no excuse. We stopped talking after we graduated high school.

I started a new job at an airport about 3 months ago. It's been 8 years since I've seen him. Until yesterday. I was on lunch in the food court and he approached me. Here's how the conversation went. I'll use K for him and M for me 

K- ""Well well if it isn't Blueoctokat""

M- (awkwardly) hey K how have you been""

K- ""Good how's the married life

(I've been married for 4 years and taken for 6)

M- ""It's great thanks.""

K- ""Yea when I saw you got married i thought
 damn I should have jumped on that when I had the chance""

(There was never any chance)

M- laughs awkwardly 

K- Yea just because we don't talk to each other in person doesn't mean I don't keep up with you on Facebook. Don't be afraid to message me. Talk to you later 

(That's not exactly what he said but it's pretty close. I think he sensed that he was weirding me out cause I wouldn't look him in the face and stopped responding. He basically admitted to stalking me on facebook)

He finally left. Honestly I'm so shocked he even had the balls to say those things to me. Part of me wants to report him to his bosses and get him to stay away from me. His comments were completely uncalled for. Why can't I escape him? Maybe it's my fault for continuing to stay friends with him all those years. I'm at a loss here and its adding stress in my life that I really don't need. I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this but I just wanted to rant and get this story out and try to figure out why I can't escape the guy who assaulted me and has been obsessed with me for almost 15 years now.

Christine Ford Testimony surfaced my virginity trauma,1,b1bab5,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b1bab5/christine_ford_testimony_surfaced_my_virginity/,0,1552630269.0,"***Trigger***

I am pretty much still thinking about Dr. Fords testimony to this day and some of the bullet points I heard people arguing to discredit her and the main thing that stuck out for me was ‚Äúhow could she remember what she was wearing but not remember how she got to the party‚Äù

Did this strike a cord for anyone else?

Back story is that I‚Äôve pretty much struggled with coming to terms of how I lost my virginity my whole life.

...was it rape? No couldn‚Äôt be? I didn‚Äôt scream.. I COULD have got out.. I let it happen

But in my core I feel it was rape.. my mind and my body said it was rape.. I just couldn‚Äôt... even though I knew I did not want to have sex. 

I was in 8th grade, either 11 or 12 years old and I had an older brother who was my best friend, we did everything together. So when he was invited to his first high school party I went with him.. I have no idea how we got to the party or how we got home the next day.. I‚Äôm assuming our mother but again, I can‚Äôt remember but I do remember exactly what I was wearing, a denim Skirt, purple shirt and brown rainbow flip flops. Most of the night I don‚Äôt remember at all actually. I was there with my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù at the time and I know we didn‚Äôt want to drink alcohol so we went into a bedroom and there was an iguana that we wanted to pet. This was the guys room who was hosting the party, D. I had never met him before but he was my brothers age and gave me attention. He had a Mohawk and nipple rings and I, being a former ‚Äúpunk girl‚Äù was star struck.  I had only been kissed once before that moment. I‚Äôm not sure how things escalated or where my friend went but all I remember was that D started to kiss me and I wanted that. I liked wanted and I liked kissing but then he kept trying to put his fingers inside me which terrified me. I had never been touched before and I did not want to be touched then. I kept clamping my legs together and trying to get him to stop but then he stoved my legs open and shoved his fingers inside me. I twisted my whole body and managed to pull away but I can still feel his finger nails scraping me inside to this day..I was terrified.. this alone was traumatic enough..so why didn‚Äôt I leave? 

I ended up staying and he assured that wouldn‚Äôt happen again so when the party was dying down and everyone was going to bed my friend and I ended up in D‚Äôs bed with another couple on the floor. All night long D spent trying to convince me to have sex but I wasn‚Äôt ready and to be honest I was still in some pain from his nail scratching me. I also didn‚Äôt know him and I had this idea that my first time would be with someone I loved and it would be special, roses on prom night.. that kind of preteen fantasy you have when you‚Äôre younger.  Anyways next thing I know D is pulling out condoms and I remember them being those gross banana flavored ones. He said he just wanted me to see them since I‚Äôd never seen a condom before but then it was he just wanted to put it on.. and that turned into okay let me just touch you with it while it‚Äôs on... and next thing I know D just keeps trying to push inside me. Was this my fault because I let it get this far? I didn‚Äôt know how to say no.. I felt so young and naive and just wanted to be liked...My legs are tight and my body‚Äôs stiff. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I keep saying no. Over and over.. but I wasn‚Äôt forceful. I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt kick or punch. I mean don‚Äôt forget there were 3 other people in this room,  one is literally laying beside me sleeping. Eventually I just go numb and stop moving. I Stop fighting and I remember closing my eyes tight and praying ‚Äúplease be over, please be over‚Äù over and over again until it had stopped.. 
The next morning my friend says to me ‚ÄúI felt so sorry for you, I heard you saying no‚Äù 
I‚Äôll never understand this.. her..me. Why didn‚Äôt I stop it? Why didn‚Äôt anyone? Why did I stay after the first assault? Why did I stay after the ‚Äúrape‚Äù? I talked to Ds mother after.. trying to just push what happened behind me. It was like I was wanting to believe that I did want it to happen. I spent the next weeks being asked about this night because obviously word got around that I had lost my virginity. And I lied. I told people ‚ÄúI was bored so we hooked up‚Äù ‚Äúyeah it was good‚Äù ..I never told one person the truth and this guy spent his time bragging about his conquest. I tried to just move on.
I never talked to the guy again and I don‚Äôt even know his name. Sometimes I want to pull out my brothers old yearbook just to find his name.. see a photo of him.. idk why. Would it help me heal and move on or cause more pain? I feel like until the #MeToo movement I just tried to suppress this memory and move on. I still can‚Äôt verbally tell my story or say the word Rape because I feel that I could have stopped this were other women have had no control at all. I‚Äôm embarrassed that my brother was there and it really ruined our relationship because I could never be honest with him. I know he looked at me differently and could never understand why I did sex at that party.I embarrassed him and myself while D was

"‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt worry, it happens all the time.",1,b1au84,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/b1au84/dont_worry_it_happens_all_the_time/,2,1552627007.0,"So this story is not as bad as some on here but the reason I‚Äôm posting about it was because of my reaction and the way it made me think after the incident. Before we proceed I will warn you that I am on my phone, so formatting issues may occur. 

So this story happened 2.5 years ago when I was 22. This was before I had kids so I was still pretty skinny with smaller breasts and would often wear tank tops and shorts in the summer because I was a lot more confident with my body than I am now post having 2 kids. 

So it‚Äôs July 2016 and I was dating a guy, let‚Äôs call him H, who was in a local heavy metal band. Now I‚Äôm not much of a drinker so I agreed to be DD for him and his parents following a show. So me and H are loading up his gear (he plays bass) into my car and walking back and forth between the venue holding hands when 2 drunk guys holler at me. Now it was July and the venue H was playing at was incredibly hot, so I was wearing a bikini top and short shorts. Anyway, here‚Äôs what happened:

Me and H holding hands waking towards my car.
Drunk Guy 1 at me: nice tits!
H: hey man, fuck off!
Drunk Guy 2: you fuck off, I was just giving her a compliment. 

At that point I urged H to walk alway as these guys were bigger than him and there was 2 of them. 

When we got to my car, H was still super upset and wondering how those guys could be so disrespectful and rude to me and how he wanted to get his band, fund them, and kick their asses. And then I said something that I still think about years later, ‚ÄúH, don‚Äôt worry about it, it happens all the time‚Äù. 

It still feels weird to me thinking about this. Those guys sexually harassed me on the street, at night and I was able to brush it off so easy. Thinking about it now being a mom to a daughter I would be furious if someone spoke to my daughter like that, yet with myself I let 2 scumbags of the hook. Maybe it‚Äôs because there wasn‚Äôt much I could do at the time (they never touched me) but it was still wrong of them to make me feel uncomfortable like that and I‚Äôm glad I had H with me because the situation may have been worse if I was walking alone at the time. 

So here I am, 2.5 years later on the internet calling these creeps out. Don‚Äôt yell, ‚Äúnice tits,‚Äù to random girls on the street, it disrespectful, it‚Äôs creepy, and most importantly it‚Äôs harassment.

What would keep you from talking about a sexual assault you experienced?,1,avjvcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/avjvcm/what_would_keep_you_from_talking_about_a_sexual/,4,1551309392.0,"Hello Redditors,
I am writing a paper on what barriers prevent female victims of sexual assault from disclosing their experiences. I believe this is an important topic because it can hinder a victim's access to support and, possibly, justice. Additionally, it prevents that victim from contributing to the support of future victims while also helping maintain a culture of victim-blaming.

I will limit the phrasing of my questions to the theoretical, 'if you experienced' rather than 'when you experienced'. However, this is not due to a lack of awareness, but rather to aid in creating an environment conducive to responses without asking victims to open up more than need be.

So I ask/
If you were to experience a sexual assault, who, if anyone, would you tell?
Can you identify distinct barriers to disclosure with different people? If so what are they? I.e What would keep you from telling your Mother/Father/Brother/Sister/ Friends/Boss/Police etc.
Can you identify any trends in who you would seek support from?
Are you comfortable providing any demographic data about yourself? E.g. Age range, location(Country/state and urban/rural), family status, career field.

This is a topic that could not be possibly covered in a handful of questions. If you would be interested in participating in a lengthier interview, please indicate as much and I may message you directly.

When I read the recent headlines regarding a gay mayor is
accused of sexual harassment, my stomach lurched.  I thought it might be referring to Robert Garcia.  I was confused, blown away, and humiliated when this happened.  A friend and I had gone to one of my all-time favorite places, Ripples in Long Beach.  They used to play the best mix of music, the dance floor was huge, and they were never too crowded on weeknights.  We were keeping to ourselves - there were only a few other folks there, when we were literally sidled up to on the dance floor by two men who were unmistakably together.  Prior to approaching us they had been dancing together.  One of the men looked familiar - it was Robert.  He was the most hated student body president during my time at CSU, Long Beach. He was, at the time, an aggressive, knee-jerk Republican at one of the largest art schools west of the Mississippi (art schools don‚Äôt appreciate this approach - point being, he was terribly not inclusive and lacked sympathy let alone empathy for the department that comprise a large percentage of the student body - we protested his rallies and wrote to the President for his removal). It was the only reason I even spoke to them when they approached - big mistake on my part seeing as I already knew Robert was unsavory.  They went from zero to sixty with moving in close and touching us like we were their dolls.  This all happened so fast and I still feel mortified reflecting on this from my own unresolved anger.  They both started pushing into us and trying to grope our breasts.  I remember them both insisting that it would be ok for us to let them touch us.  My friend, RMA, said, ‚ÄúBut I have a husband‚Äù (we were dummy deer in the headlights) to which Robert replied something to the effect that her husband wouldn‚Äôt mind because he and his boyfriend were gay.   It wraps up with Robert threatening me to not tell anyone he is gay.  This has always disturbed me and I laughed it off for years.  Even at the start of the Me, too Movement I laughed it off, ‚ÄúYeah, my me, too story is with a gay guy!‚Äù It‚Äôs taken me a long time to understand this predatory behavior from gay men toward women (straight, gay, and beyond üåàüí™) - but this shit happens more than anyone is discussing.  Now, it all feels like disgust  (mostly with myself for being so naive) that I must continue to work through.  Thank you Any and All who read this post.  Even this more simplistic sexual harassment was a mind fuck for me.  I never even told my at the time boyfriend - looking back on this, this was my red flag of shame silently being raised.

The Creepy Supervisor: an experience in subtle harrassment.,1,at7hxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/at7hxu/the_creepy_supervisor_an_experience_in_subtle/,0,1550778365.0,"
At the time I was 19, there was flirting between me and a 25 yo supervisor for quite some time. Initially I didn't mind but one night after a few drinks I bluntly asked if he wanted to sleep with me (stupid I know). He said ""no"" but that I shouldn't worry and that he wouldn't ""be awkward about it"". My natural train of thought was not to sweat it, give him space, move on and find other people to sleep with. Since he was the one to say ""no"" I figured he would be on the same page and would back off and try to create distance, but instead everything intensified. He immediately started liking a bunch of pictures on my social media pages after our conversation (literally within hours);¬† I ignored it because I figured he was trying to play mind games.¬†


It was non-sexual but he also started calling and texting me more frequently than other employees. Sometimes he would text and call me needlessly for personal things like my birthday, or a few minutes before a interview to make sure I was prepared (This felt patronizing) or even immediately after we had just seen each other in our weekly training sessions. There was a point where he called me everyday for a week, multiple times a day for small updates that could've easily been sent and better communicated in an email. He also started to offer to help me with personal favors, asking me multiple times if I wanted his help even after I declined.


¬†In a one-on-one meeting about work the conversation became unnerving, he asked If he was making me uncomfortable and stated that he ""didn't want to draw too much attention to 'us'"".¬† If he perceived that I was ignoring him he would get aggressive with me. For example he did things such as raising his voice at me, or loudly knocking on my desk if I didn't notice that he had said ""hi"" to me. He exhibited other strange behaviors, for example he would stand extremely close behind me while I was unaware as a ""joke"". He started liking more of my ""sexy"" pictures on social media.¬†


One night he texted me asking if I wanted to talk over the phone. I ignored the message because I was drinking with friends and was pretty inebriated. The next day he confronted me about it. He asked if I got his message and I told him that I had. He then says ""oh, so you weren't feeling it?"" I was taken aback and confused so I stayed silent. He gets angrier and says "" I was out of town for a week!"" I just shrugged my shoulders and he walked off in a huff. I later apologized since it seemed like he was hurt by it and he replied with ""I understand that sometimes we aren't in the place to respond but you don't want to alienate people who are looking out for you."" I figured I could just put up with him since the job was temporary and I would finally be leaving in 3 months, but at this point I was frightened and creeped out by his behavior.¬†


I ended up leaving the job early because the stress was eating away at my mental health. I worked with women involved in prostitution. I witnessed women come in with terrible injuries and stories of rape as the weather started to get warmer. It really took a toll on me, I had 3 anxiety attacks that year alone and recently started fainting. 

 I was in the exiting process of the job and this guy just wouldn't leave me alone. Towards the end he would always say things such as ""i'll see you later?"" Even though he knew I had quit and was leaving. I was honestly frightened to the point where I was afraid to be at home by myself. I knew he had access to my personal information, I wasn't frightened of him getting physical with me but I was scared that he would decide to just show up at my house. I decided to confront and tell him that he needed to back off. His response was extremely defensive and angry. 


In preparation for whatever might come next I decided to stay at a friend's house for a few days. My friend suggested to me that I should report his behavior  but I felt like I was in a catch 22. I knew my chances of bumping into him outside of work were high as we worked in the same field and shared friends. I figured they wouldn't believe me or would try to blame me for it because I made the ""first move"" so to say. Between continuing to feel unsafe and staying silent I decided to report.¬†¬†


Predictably I was gas-lighted by the job, hit with excuses such as ""it's just a misunderstanding"" and ""he was just doing his job."" I had to pursue them for months to get a resolution to my complaint. To make matters worse the person in charge of my investigation admitted she lied to me at certain points. The organization ended up strong-arming me, telling me that this supervisor hadn't done anything wrong and that I wasn't allowed to speak out about my experience.¬†


After the whole ordeal I blocked the supervisors number and all of his social media accounts. I ran into him again at a bar. Thankfully he didn't speak to me but he kept turning around to stare.

How can it be a lie
When I drink to get by 
to get the courage
to tell about my wreckage 
to tell it like it is
the worst way to reminisce  

I might wake up somewhere new
With someone new 
Because it‚Äôs easier to say yes 
than be forced to undress 

then it‚Äôs proof to most of you 
you‚Äôll say, there were quite a few 
don‚Äôt you remember those guys? 
you must be telling lies 
you couldn‚Äôt have said no
they say I‚Äôm in it for the show
all those times before 
apparently it‚Äôs me that‚Äôs easier to ignore

just Because I agree to someone new 
someone in Lieu of you  
someone who had a clue
someone who knew 
someone on the downswing
Someone who anything
Someone who just wasn‚Äôt you
so obviously my story can‚Äôt be true 



you were insistent
I was resistant
in an instant
I‚Äôm  distant 
consumed by the reminder
of the last i was positioned a liar 
all because his desire
made me a survivor

like you all conspire
on what‚Äôs about to transpire
again. I‚Äôm back to a fighter 
and still blamed for my attire. 

for you, that was sufficient 
my consent was nonexistent
unbareably  convenient 
there was no agreement 

How can it be a lie?
I even asked you to try
Try and tell me your story 
how we were both just horny  
your version isn‚Äôt strong
You knew it was wrong.  

But it doesn‚Äôt hang over you every day
You didn‚Äôt lose an hour, a minute away 
You told me to wait 
You told me it wasn‚Äôt for debate 
but your word held zero weight 
and you just create
some story to keep it straight 

You rehearsed 
your lie was first
My truth was cursed  

Later, I have a chance to press:
do  you remember me saying yes
and you basically confess 
your answer wasnt slow 
it was an easy no
So how can it be a lie,
when that‚Äôs your reply? ",1,0,meToo,wslmk75,1,2018-11-01 07:22:24

Need advice on recent incestuous incident,1,9khq1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9khq1i/need_advice_on_recent_incestuous_incident/,4,1538410442.0,"Hi all. I've been struggling with how to think and react to something that happened to me recently. This is my first post on this site so please excuse any posting norms that I'm missing/breaching... Also, sorry if this is too long or vague. 

Let me provide a bit of context to my situation: 

I'm a 26 y/o straight male in a loving and committed relationship with a girl, A. About a year ago, I moved to a new city for graduate school where I didn't know anyone except for her basically. Then a month ago, my girlfriend moved across the country for her own graduate school. 

A week after she moved, my 28 y/o male cousin, X, said he would come visit me to hang out, play video and board games (we're both gamers) and tour the city. We hadn't hung out in a while (since my move a year prior) and so I was pretty happy to have a friend in the city for the weekend, especially since A had just moved. He had always been a favorite cousin of mine since we shared many similar interests, but he had had many social difficulties over the years which began with bullying as a child by other kids. In recent years, he had a string a close friendships with guys that seemed to really become toxic and spiteful, but was usually painted by X as the other person being a jerk or asshole. After what happened with me, I'm not so sure of that. 

My cousin took a bus up that Saturday morning and we spent the afternoon/evening catching up and seeing many of the city sites. During our conversations, it became apparent that X was really keen on going out and getting hammered with me, which he frequently did with his coworkers and friends. While I would occasionally have a glass of wine or maybe some with my gf over dinner, I hadn't really gone out seeking to get drunk in over a year, which I told X. He kind of brushed that aside, saying that he was only visiting for the weekend and that he was going to make sure I had fun. In fact, he had brought a gift for me of two different expensive liquor bottles. 

 I appreciated that sentiment and resolved myself to a night of drinking. It began with a couple of beers at dinner. So far, so good. After dinner, we went to visit a mutual friend who had just moved to a new apartment in the city, and my cousin suggested we get a whisky bottle as a housewarming gift. I thought that was a nice gesture, so we stopped at a liquor store near our friend's apartment before visiting. At our friend's place, the three of us got pretty drunk over the course of a few hours. Around  midnight, my cousin ordered him and myself an uber to my small apartment. 

This is where my memory starts to get very spotty. 

At my place (literally just a room in small apartment that I share with 4 other students), I vaguely remember putting on a Netflix show that my cousin had insisted that we watch. The drinking must have continued because the next day I found two red solo cups with alcohol from his gift liquors to me left over in them. I have no memory of having these drinks. I have no memory of the show that we put on. I have no memory of calling my girlfriend at 1 in the morning, nor the conversation she had with my cousin that she told me about the next day (which I will discuss shortly). But I do remember at some point sitting at the foot of my bed and vomiting on the floor (disgusting, I know) before lying in my bed to try to sleep off the sick feeling. I think my cousin cleaned that up while I was attempting to sleep because I don't remember how it was cleaned for my next moment of clarity.

My next memory is lying in my bed facing the wall, with X lying behind me telling me to ""relax (my name), just relax"". He had his hand going down the front of my shorts and underwear, touching and tugging at me, clearly trying to get me hard. I froze for a moment as awareness of my situation came to me. I distinctly remember that moment of sobering clarity, because I thought to myself, ""wow, this is actually happening to me right now. I am being sexually violated."" Adrenaline rushed in and I pushed him away from me and told him to stop. I  went to the bathroom down the hall from my room to sober up more and evaluate the situation. I think I might have vomited again but I'm not sure. 

When I calmed myself a bit, I returned to my room. My cousin quickly excused himself to use the bathroom himself, so I took the time to blow up the still-deflated air mattress I had gotten for his visit and plan out what I was going to say. When X returned from the bathroom, I told him to sit in a chair because we needed to talk. He still seemed drunk but aware of how serious I was. I told him what he had just done was not okay. He asked what he had done. I got louder and said it wasn't okay. He said something along the lines of ""I was really drunk and I'm not sure what happened."" I don't think that was entirely the truth. We had a long conversation from about 230am (when I woke up) to 430/5 am. X, who had always presented himself as straight but family members had frequently questioned this, claimed he was bisexual, though specifically he was hetero-romantic (spelling?). He had had this kind of sexual relationship with his male friends where they jerked each other off or something like that. X expressed disgust with himself for doing this to his cousin, but I told him that on top of that issue, there was no way someone in my state of unconsciousness could have ever consented to anything being done. 

He offered to leave immediately for a hotel but at that point I felt sober enough to be fine. He stayed on the air mattress. The rest of his visit was really awkward as I tried to forget what had happened that previous night and play a good host, while he expressed remorse and shame. My gf called me the following day to tell me about the phone call. Apparently she could hear that I was extremely drunk, then my cousin took the phone from me and told her that I was his this weekend, which instantly set off alarms in her mind. As it stands she simply hates him for these bad vibes, but I haven't told her how accurate her alarms actually were. To this day, I have told no one about what transpired, and simply told family members and friends that X and I were no longer on good terms due to a really bad fight/argument over alcohol. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone have advice for how I should go about this situation? Am I overreacting? Should I tell people? I don't want to cause a huge explosion in my family dynamic, and X seemed truly remorseful and was seeking therapy/counseling when I spoke to him a few days later. What should I do?",1,0,meToo,affectionatecourage,1,2018-10-01 19:14:02

But he's looking at a possibility of 10 years.  Even the three years floating around is essentially a life sentence at his age.

So, what went 'wrong' (or 'right', if you will)?

I propose it is his race.  We live in a world where an accused sexual predator is president and a second is about a week away from a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.  But they're white folks.  Cosby has his race going against him.

I'M WORRIED I WAS A #METOO OFFENDER.,1,9idb4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/9idb4z/im_worried_i_was_a_metoo_offender/,2,1537747830.0,"First off, I'm a huge supporter of the #MeToo movement. It's long overdue and I have little sympathy for the men who have lost their careers and livelihoods because of their atrocious actions. I also don't believe that ""he was young,"" ""he was drunk"" or ""it was a different time"" are excuses.

That said, since the movement began, I've been losing sleep and feeling a growing guilt in my gut that I may have been one of the offenders. 

I hate to think this. It goes against everything in my soul and in my heart. And it's tearing me apart. My actions were inappropriate but part of me still wants to think that what I did was not the same. But if it is, I want to make amends however possible. 

I know it's a long post but if you have a moment, please hear my story and tell me what you think. 

Backstory: I started college out of state and quickly began looking for extra jobs on campus. I'm a pretty liberal nice guy and got along with people great. I ended up signing up to work in student housing in my second year. We were tasked with working with the freshman and providing resources when they needed them. 

Technically, I only worked with one other person, the other employee assigned to my floor. Besides that and my supervisor,  everyone else was in the same department but assigned to separate buildings. We would come together once per week to share what we were doing for our floors and hear any updates. 

Because we are student employees, many of us quickly became friends and had close relationships. I became closer and closer to half a dozen of the other students who were working the same position as me in a different building. 

 Now here's one of the most important things to know. I was gay. And far, far in the closet. 

At the time, I was not out to my family or friends. I was worried about losing family or even being viewed differently. Plus, I genuinely had attraction to women still (though not nearly as much as men) so I could date women and not really be obvious. 

Now, a LOT of guys in my area of the country are not out of the closet in college. I'd say more than half the gay men I know were still playing it straight freshman and sophomore year. So it's not always easy seeking out the other men who might be interested. When you're in that situation, it becomes a kind of dance. You're talking, getting closer and more open, start making jokes that might be weird with your straight buddies and see how they respond. Usually we can seek each other out and end up hooking up or even just being open with each other in private. 

So back to working in the dorms: I had been working on the campus and had been feeling out several guys who worked the same position as me in different buildings. Maybe this sounds overly flirtatious but this is four guys out of dozens and dozens over the course of the whole year. 

I'm embarrassed to show had bad I am at flirting. I usually shared the same script. When I had a feeling that a guy might be in the closet too (and that he might be interested in me) I'd develop a good daily texting relationship. With each of them (at different times) I would try to say or ask something that would help me tell. Usually cracking a joke about morning wood or needing someone's help with blue balls. (Again, I'm not a player and I'm embarrassed by these comments.) 

At the end of the semester, I got called into my supervisor's office. All of us who worked on campus had a great relationship with her and were very open about things. She told me that one of the guys I'd been texting had told her I had texted something inappropriate to them. I've never been so embarrassed in my life. I threw up when I finally left the room. It was by far the worst day of my life. 

Though she never told me who reported it (for their privacy) I've always wondered which of the four guys I'd been talking to had reported it to her. 

Of the four guys, two of them I'd actually had some sexual interaction with before it was reported to her. But of them, I found out from a mutual friend that one of them had gotten mad at me at some point (though I was never told why) and actually apologized for blocking me on Facebook. 

I've felt serious guilt for several years ever since this incident. When the #MeToo movement happened, I started to feel that this event may constitute an abusive workplace relationship and it's bothered me ever since. 

I don't need you to reassure me but I do want to see what you all feel: is this a #MeToo offense? Or is it not the same since it was a worker I don't directly work with and who is not a subordinate? 

Thank you for your opinion. Maybe I'm dumb but I need some kind of resolution in my mind. 

(Couple notes: this was a dumb and inappropriate comment for sure. I'm just torn about whether it crosses the line into abuse. 

I also am on good terms with all four men, though I still know one of them was the one that made the comment.

I also work in the entertainment industry. Outside of the guilt for the event itself, I also worry about it coming out years from now and seeing my face on a national article about men in power sexually abusing others.)

This is a classic example of no due process within the metoo/timesup movements. Tears and a testimonial are not proof of a crime. It warrants looking into just like if the accused claims innocence is also supposed to be given the benefit of the doubt unless proven guilty.

I'll never fully support these movements unless false accusations are considered a crime because even the innocent are subject to loss of employment and affiliation in all circles. 

Had this women not been clearing out her victim's homes, then she might have gotten away with it.

Ladies - why do you do it?,1,806vi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/806vi8/ladies_why_do_you_do_it/,11,1519587852.0,"I know I will be slam dunked for this by women everywhere but please read the following first. I would like to hear answers to the question posed in the title.

There is no question that women have had a raw deal throughout history. They did and still do most of the domestic chores and child rearing. Men have always used the old cop out that it is simple biology. They are more ""suited"" for it. My personal opinion - that is BULL. Lots of men today have proven otherwise. They share housework, cooking, and parenting with their wives. Many single men and all male couples do the same. I also agree that the number of men willing to share needs to grow.

Women were not ""persons"" and could not vote. They were not doctors or lawyers or airline pilots and were not admitted to the institutions that controlled those disciplines. Thankfully many of those stereotypes have disappeared as well.

We need more female national leaders - I firmly believe that.

Men's attitudes to women and sex have also been totally out to lunch. Too many single guys - and married ones also - see a date as a box office ticket to sex. Many true low lives even use drugs and chemicals to achieve this. These men have crawled out from under a rock.  On a similar level with these, are men who use their superior position in employment situations to do the same. The ""Me Too"" movement was overdue.

There is still an attitude - I believe more in the USA than elsewhere - that carving notches in your bedpost even after marriage is what men must do to prove their manhood. I can still ""get"" a woman. I still have it. Marriage vows be damned.

OK you hopefully get my drift. And by the way, I don't drift. But I would REALLY like to know why so many women are guilty of certain behaviours. We hear plenty about men.

A classic example - unfortunately for him - was the Tiger Woods scandal. There are lots of others - politicians and ""celebrities."" When it broke, the rumours were that he had cheated with something like ten or twelve women. For weeks - literally - my wife listened to female talk shows on which this was the daily topic. They always asked ""Why are men such bastards?""

Here goes. Why ladies did all of your sisters sleep with him? They KNEW it was wrong but they did it anyway. They cheated on his wife and kids just as much as he did and in some cases they probably cheated on their own spouse, partner, or kids. Tiger was not their boss, teacher, or priest. I never heard that he forced them or gave them drugs. They knew he had a wife, had kids, and that what they were doing was WRONG! They did it anyway.

Never did I hear an entire show devoted to this question. If you are going to generalize and refer to men as bastards, then permit me to ask why were so many women sleazy? They cheated on one of their own. What's more, it is the same for any such scandal even if there is only one mistress involved.

Women imply they are in some way holier than men and yet I hear no explanation. It always takes two to dance that particular Tango and like any other dance request, they can say NO.

Therefore on a scale of sleaze, to me this has men scoring 1 but women scoring 10 or 12 - the gold medal.

I don't want to hop on a soapbox, but I do want some help (this will not be the only place I post this). I am trying to do something that has multiple benefits, so if you're willing to read this through thank you. 
I am creating my own (but equally the communities') nonprofit, and funding to achieve some things is difficult right now. (If you need more information PM me), but I am also a sexual assault victim. Since it happened I've searched far and wide for the right steps of grieving, how I should be handling it, etc.  Within society this isn't something that's supposed to happen, so the best that there is might be considered group therapy. 
I would like to draft a book, called ""There is no self-help book""... Aimed towards victims who are having difficulty struggling with their circumstance. This book is to be a collection of stories of what happened to other past victims, and what aided or hindered their journey into recovery. Chicken noodle soup for whoever, in short. 
I would love for the proceeds (eventually) to go towards creating my nonprofit! 
If you are interested in helping please let me know.

He was a reliable liberal voice, but with a troubling record on sexual harassment and ""Being fresh!"" https://www.gq.com/story/kennedy-ted-senator-profile

It appears he was a big womanizer who likely crossed the line. He died in 2009, but wasn't all that old and could conceivably have still been living.

Males #MeToo #Veterans,1,7jtaa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/7jtaa1/males_metoo_veterans/,2,1513274129.0,"#MeToo

Recent events in public discourse brings to the light of day harrowing experiences, encounters from victims of sexual harassment, aggression and abuse. Some of the assertions are powerful, all share a common thread  and  are emotional.  These alleged victims encounters with persons who held power and influence over their careers and livelihood should be investigated and justice dispensed accordingly. 

Too long victims of these allegations have been hidden away in the dark for whatever reasons, shame, disgust, fear of reprisals and the greatest fear of approaching the media and their recollections being dismissed. 

Two things which stands out to me is that all the alleged victims are females and that those accused are in the entertainment industry and our government.  I stand and bear testimony that this endemic is not regulated only to those spheres. I submit that the predators are cloaked within all levels our society.  

Such violations have a lasting effect upon the victims mental and physical health.  Sometimes such aggression cripple the victims in accomplishing what might be the simplest of daily tasks.   

I cannot speak of other allegations nor to the manner of which they coped but only of my own experiences which handicapped but not paralyzed my life.  It crippled me but did not hinder my strong determination to preserver. 

As a U.S. Army veteran I  was officially diagnosed by the Veterans Administration as suffering from service-connected chronic depression associated with PTSD-MST (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ‚Äì Military Sexual Trauma).  During my brief military enlistment, I was harassed, bullied and sexually assaulted. Several months after the attack I was honorably discharged from active duty in 1984 and I was assigned to the Army IRR until 1989. Upon separation, the afterthought of medical diagnosis nor treatment was given consideration by the attending medical officers.  This did not occur until 2011-2012. 

After the alleged incidents within a very short span of time I became a reclusive. Something was clearly wrong with me but I did not know what. The normal daily routines became cumbersome challenges. This  brought  periods of anger, mistrust of people and forced me into a secret, protective existence.  

I had no champion(s) nor support groups  because I was unaware of what was going on with me mentally.  Without counsel, I navigated the best way that I knew how. 

I fought the darkness and chronic depression which accompanied me for many years until 2012. More than twenty-five years passed before I reached out for a medical intervention. 

I empathize with every victim who has come forward as of late. Their recollections evoked feelings and emotions both bitter and sweet. 

I hide so much and lost even more during my own private traverse and suffering.  Yet, I regret not one decision nor moment of the life I‚Äôve lived and my experiences to this point. 

So, yes, I applauded loudly those individuals sharing their experiences.  But there is still much work to be done eradicating cynicism and the stigma associated with coming forward in our society. Education of the public is the key.  

I admonish those strong survivors with voices to not to forget those who have perished ( committed suicide)  who were unable to overcome the dark places which the mind so often leads.  I can now freely admit that I have been upon that path without shame. 

Today I am even more committed to a project which I began in 2012 after my own diagnosis, assisting veterans who struggled with #MeToo moments, long before it became acceptable to talk about in public discourse. 

Because this forum will not permit me I cannot write some things in this public space but be assured that I am fast upon a journey to help myself and others overcome their nightmares.

Often times when wearing proudly my veteran military apparel citizens well wisher often stop to shake my hand and say to me ""Thank You For Your Service."" If they knew my story and challenges and those of similar veterans  I have no doubt that words would be placed in deeds of action. 

So, as I continue to fight, not for revenge moreover for reconciliation with my inner self and to succeed in helping others who have  had a #MeToo experience.  It is my fervent prayer that all victims are respected and given the help they might need.  The media is eager to  write about the celebrities however keep in mind that there are tens of thousands of average citizens whose stories are just as devastating and equally as disruptive to their lives. 

Lifting the shame whether self-imagined or culturally enforced when we as a society can talk about, we as a society are better for it.  There will be those allegations which will not be true as is the case in anything however we cannot allow our politicians, leaders, military nor businesses ignore or be dismissive of the incidents which are real.

Everyday is a challenge for me but I solider on. After all, I am American and a former solider what else could I do. Surrender isn't  no nor ever has been an option.
